| **[Multi-Agent Evolve: LLM Self-Improve through Co-evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23595v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fixing It in Post: A Comparative Study of LLM Post-Training Data Quality and Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06522v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Can We Effectively Expand the Vocabulary of LLMs with 0.01GB of Target Language Text?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11477v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in many languages beyond English. Yet, LLMs require more inference steps when generating non-English text due to their reliance on English-centric tokenizers and vocabulary, resulting in higher usage costs to non-English speakers. Vocabulary expansion with target language tokens is a widely used cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation approach to remedy this issue. Despite its effectiveness in inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on high-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target language data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and adapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this article, we investigate vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding initialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we establish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster inference, while striving to maintain competitive downstream performance to baselines. This is achieved with only 30K sentences ($\sim$0.01GB text data) from the target language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Computational Linguistics</p></details> |
| **[AutoStreamPipe: LLM Assisted Automatic Generation of Data Stream Processing Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23408v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering (SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these approaches within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. Moreover, we show initial evidence of our findings generalizing to the OpenHands agent scaffold. We find that a simple environment observation masking strategy halves cost relative to the raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that further reduces costs by 7% and 11% compared to just observation masking or LLM summarization, respectively. Our findings raise concerns regarding the trend towards pure LLM summarization and provide initial evidence of untapped cost reductions by pushing the efficiency-effectiveness frontier. We release code and data for reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: D...</summary><p>v3: DL4C camera-ready version to be presented at the 4th DL4C workshop co-located with NeurIPS '25; added OpenHands generality probe, added hybrid context management strategy</p></details> |
| **[A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08343v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in a computer science workshop</p></details> |
| **[NestedFP: High-Performance, Memory-Efficient Dual-Precision Floating Point Support for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02024v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meeting service-level objectives (SLOs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving is critical, but managing the high variability in load presents a significant challenge. Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.</p></details> |  |
| **[How AI Forecasts AI Jobs: Benchmarking LLM Predictions of Labor Market Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23358v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports, and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool in the context of labor markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + Limitations + References</p></details> |

We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated 3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models, Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INLG 2025</p></details> |

| **[Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23596v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction.

| **[Superficial Self-Improved Reasoners Benefit from Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02103v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As scaled language models (LMs) approach human-level reasoning capabilities, self-improvement emerges as a solution to synthesizing high-quality data corpus. While previous research has identified model collapse as a risk in self-improvement, where model outputs become increasingly deterministic, we discover a more fundamental challenge: the superficial self-improved reasoners phenomenon. In particular, our analysis reveals that even when LMs show improved in-domain (ID) reasoning accuracy, they actually compromise their generalized reasoning capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks due to memorization rather than genuine. Through a systematic investigation of LM architecture, we discover that during self-improvement, LM weight updates are concentrated in less reasoning-critical layers, leading to superficial learning. To address this, we propose Iterative Model Merging (IMM), a method that strategically combines weights from original and self-improved models to preserve generalization while incorporating genuine reasoning improvements. Our approach effectively mitigates both LM collapse and superficial learning, moving towards more stable self-improving systems.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23509v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

| **[VOLD: Reasoning Transfer from LLMs to Vision-Language Models via On-Policy Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23497v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.</p></details> | <details><summary>www.w...</summary><p>www.walidbousselham.com/VOLD/</p></details> |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

While many works have focused on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First, we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate Human Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17516v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: http://simbench.tiancheng.hu/ Data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/pitehu/SimBench</p></details> |

This work introduces ZeroFlood, a geospatial foundation model framework for data-efficient FSM. The approach fine-tunes Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning, enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 imagery. Using paired EO and simulated flood maps from data-rich regions, ZeroFlood bridges data availability gaps through cross-modal representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that TiM enhances model robustness, with the TerraMind-Large configuration achieving an F1 score of 67.21. The results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation-model-based FSM as a scalable and data-efficient solution for flood risk management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to EUSAR 2026 (under review)</p></details> |

BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning; (2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment. TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.</p></details> |  |

Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational overhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |

In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Urban Micromobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23576v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills: low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies show that fine-tuning can erode safety alignment, causing LLMs to respond to harmful or unethical prompts. Many methods to realign safety have been proposed, but often introduce custom algorithms that are difficult to implement or compromise task utility. In this work, we propose SafeMERGE, a lightweight, post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining downstream performance. SafeMERGE selectively merges fine-tuned with safety-aligned model layers only when they deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. Across three LLMs and two tasks, SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other defenses, with negligible or even positive impact on utility. Our results demonstrate that selective layer-wise merging offers an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety during fine-tuning, establishing SafeMERGE as a simple post-fine-tuning defense.</p></details> |  |

However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.</p></details> |  |
| **[DmC: Nearest Neighbor Guidance Diffusion Model for Offline Cross-domain Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20499v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025; offline cross-domain reinforcement learning with a guided diffusion model;</p></details> |

However, most existing methods are designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research introduces ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel multimodal deep learning framework that classifies musculoskeletal risk using both visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. A custom multimodal dataset (MusDis-Sports) was created by combining images and skeletal coordinates, with each sample labeled into eight risk categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) system. ViSK-GAT integrates two innovative modules: the Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which refines inter-modal features via cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal alignment between image features and coordinates. The model achieved robust performance, with all key metrics exceeding 93%. Regression results also indicated a low RMSE of 0.1205 and MAE of 0.0156. ViSK-GAT consistently outperformed nine popular transfer learning backbones and showed its potential to advance AI-driven musculoskeletal risk assessment and enable early, impactful interventions in sports.</p></details> |  |
