| **[TwinRL-VLA: Digital Twin-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09023v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[$χ_{0}$: Resource-Aware Robust Manipulation via Taming Distributional Inconsistencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09021v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $χ_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $π_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contact-Anchored Policies: Contact Conditioning Creates Strong Robot Utility Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09017v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[CIC-Trap4Phish: A Unified Multi-Format Dataset for Phishing and Quishing Attachment Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09015v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing attacks represents one of the primary attack methods which is used by cyber attackers. In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats. For QR code-based phishing (quishing), two complementary methods were implemented: image-based detection by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lexical analysis of decoded URLs using recent lightweight language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dexterous Manipulation Policies from RGB Human Videos via 4D Hand-Object Trajectory Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09013v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like "Bingo". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent "Cognitive Gap" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://greenoso.github.io/NextGen-CAPTCHAs_webpage/</p></details> |
| **[ANCRe: Adaptive Neural Connection Reassignment for Efficient Depth Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09009v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling network depth has been a central driver behind the success of modern foundation models, yet recent investigations suggest that deep layers are often underutilized. This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective. Rigorous analysis proves that the layout of residual connections can fundamentally shape convergence behavior, and even induces an exponential gap in convergence rates. Prompted by this insight, we introduce adaptive neural connection reassignment (ANCRe), a principled and lightweight framework that parameterizes and learns residual connectivities from the data. ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth. Extensive numerical tests across pre-training of large language models, diffusion models, and deep ResNets demonstrate consistently accelerated convergence, boosted performance, and enhanced depth efficiency over conventional residual connections.</p></details> |  |

| **[Beyond Transcripts: A Renewed Perspective on Audio Chaptering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08979v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio chaptering, the task of automatically segmenting long-form audio into coherent sections, is increasingly important for navigating podcasts, lectures, and videos. Despite its relevance, research remains limited and text-based, leaving key questions unresolved about leveraging audio information, handling ASR errors, and transcript-free evaluation. We address these gaps through three contributions: (1) a systematic comparison between text-based models with acoustic features, a novel audio-only architecture (AudioSeg) operating on learned audio representations, and multimodal LLMs; (2) empirical analysis of factors affecting performance, including transcript quality, acoustic features, duration, and speaker composition; and (3) formalized evaluation protocols contrasting transcript-dependent text-space protocols with transcript-invariant time-space protocols. Our experiments on YTSeg reveal that AudioSeg substantially outperforms text-based approaches, pauses provide the largest acoustic gains, and MLLMs remain limited by context length and weak instruction following, yet MLLMs are promising on shorter audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnomSeer: Reinforcing Multimodal LLMs to Reason for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08868v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is an emerging area, yet a persistent challenge remains: MLLMs rely on coarse time-series heuristics but struggle with multi-dimensional, detailed reasoning, which is vital for understanding complex time-series data. We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[TiFRe: Text-guided Video Frame Reduction for Efficient Video Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08861v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Video Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Video MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in video-language tasks such as video understanding and question answering. However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoVeritas: AI-Generated Video Detection via Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08828v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing capability of video generation poses escalating security risks, making reliable detection increasingly essential. In this paper, we introduce VideoVeritas, a framework that integrates fine-grained perception and fact-based reasoning. We observe that while current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capacity, their granular perception ability remains limited. To mitigate this, we introduce Joint Preference Alignment and Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning (PPRL). Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods tend to bias towards either superficial reasoning or mechanical analysis, while VideoVeritas achieves more balanced performance across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://github.com/EricTan7/VideoVeritas</p></details> |

Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation. The results demonstrate its superior ability to follow complex compositional instructions in video editing, while also achieving competitive or superior quality in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/Omni-Video2-project/</p></details> |
| **[From Correspondence to Actions: Human-Like Multi-Image Spatial Reasoning in Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08735v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in single-image spatial reasoning, multi-image spatial reasoning, which requires integration of information from multiple viewpoints, remains challenging. Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions mainly use supervised learning, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether body region detection in volumetric CT and MR images can be achieved in a fully zero-shot manner by using knowledge embedded in large pre-trained foundation models. We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage. The MLLM performs competitively in visually distinctive regions, while the segmentation-aware MLLM reveals fundamental limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit.

| **[Vista: Scene-Aware Optimization for Streaming Video Question Answering under Post-Hoc Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08448v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming video question answering (Streaming Video QA) poses distinct challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as video frames arrive sequentially and user queries can be issued at arbitrary time points. Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.</p></details> |  |

| **[TwinRL-VLA: Digital Twin-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09023v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[$χ_{0}$: Resource-Aware Robust Manipulation via Taming Distributional Inconsistencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09021v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $χ_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $π_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contact-Anchored Policies: Contact Conditioning Creates Strong Robot Utility Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09017v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[CIC-Trap4Phish: A Unified Multi-Format Dataset for Phishing and Quishing Attachment Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09015v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing attacks represents one of the primary attack methods which is used by cyber attackers. In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats. For QR code-based phishing (quishing), two complementary methods were implemented: image-based detection by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lexical analysis of decoded URLs using recent lightweight language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dexterous Manipulation Policies from RGB Human Videos via 4D Hand-Object Trajectory Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09013v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like "Bingo". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent "Cognitive Gap" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://greenoso.github.io/NextGen-CAPTCHAs_webpage/</p></details> |
| **[ANCRe: Adaptive Neural Connection Reassignment for Efficient Depth Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09009v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling network depth has been a central driver behind the success of modern foundation models, yet recent investigations suggest that deep layers are often underutilized. This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective. Rigorous analysis proves that the layout of residual connections can fundamentally shape convergence behavior, and even induces an exponential gap in convergence rates. Prompted by this insight, we introduce adaptive neural connection reassignment (ANCRe), a principled and lightweight framework that parameterizes and learns residual connectivities from the data. ANCRe adaptively reassigns residual connections with negligible computational and memory overhead ($<1\%$), while enabling more effective utilization of network depth. Extensive numerical tests across pre-training of large language models, diffusion models, and deep ResNets demonstrate consistently accelerated convergence, boosted performance, and enhanced depth efficiency over conventional residual connections.</p></details> |  |
