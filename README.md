| **[Ensemble-size-dependence of deep-learning post-processing methods that minimize an (un)fair score: motivating examples and a proof-of-concept solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15830v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fair scores reward ensemble forecast members that behave like samples from the same distribution as the verifying observations. They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion. We introduce trajectory transformers as a proof-of-concept that ensemble-size independence can be achieved. This approach is an adaptation of the Post-processing Ensembles with Transformers (PoET) framework and applies self-attention over lead time while preserving the conditional independence required by aCRPS. When applied to weekly mean $T_{2m}$ forecasts from the ECMWF subseasonal forecasting system, this approach successfully reduces systematic model biases whilst also improving or maintaining forecast reliability regardless of the ensemble size used in training (3 vs 9 members) or real-time forecasts (9 vs 100 members).</p></details> |  |
| **[Dex4D: Task-Agnostic Point Track Policy for Sim-to-Real Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15828v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dex4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Hunt Globally: Wide Search AI Agents for Drug Asset Scouting in Investing, Business Development, and Competitive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15019v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests that over 85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total. A growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at 30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucination. We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real-deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. On this benchmark, our Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 score, outperforming Claude Opus 4.6 (56.2%), Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research (50.6%), OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro (46.6%), Perplexity Deep Research (44.2%), and Exa Websets (26.9%). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.</p></details> |  |
| **[stable-worldmodel-v1: Reproducible World Modeling Research and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08968v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World Models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning compact, predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling agents to reason, plan, and generalize beyond direct experience. Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computation and Size of Interpolants for Hybrid Modal Logics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15821v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has established complexity results for the problem of deciding the existence of interpolants in logics lacking the Craig Interpolation Property (CIP). The proof techniques developed so far are non-constructive, and no meaningful bounds on the size of interpolants are known. Hybrid modal logics (or modal logics with nominals) are a particularly interesting class of logics without CIP: in their case, CIP cannot be restored without sacrificing decidability and, in applications, interpolants in these logics can serve as definite descriptions and separators between positive and negative data examples in description logic knowledge bases. In this contribution we show, using a new hypermosaic elimination technique, that in many standard hybrid modal logics Craig interpolants can be computed in fourfold exponential time, if they exist. On the other hand, we show that the existence of uniform interpolants is undecidable, which is in stark contrast to modal or intuitionistic logic where uniform interpolants always exist.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoSketcher: Video Models Prior Enable Versatile Sequential Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15819v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.</p></details> |  |

Simulation offers an apt, systematic approach to generating diverse synthetic data. This chapter introduces the reader to the key concepts, benefits, and challenges of simulation-based synthetic data generation for AI training purposes, and to a reference framework to describe, design, and analyze digital twin-based AI simulation solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Agnostic Continual Learning for Chest Radiograph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15811v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Perceptive Humanoid Parkour: Chaining Dynamic Human Skills via Motion Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15827v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Stabilizing Test-Time Adaptation of High-Dimensional Simulation Surrogates via D-Optimal Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15820v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning surrogates are increasingly used in engineering to accelerate costly simulations, yet distribution shifts between training and deployment often cause severe performance degradation (e.g., unseen geometries or configurations). Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate such shifts, but existing methods are largely developed for lower-dimensional classification with structured outputs and visually aligned input-output relationships, making them unstable for the high-dimensional, unstructured and regression problems common in simulation. We address this challenge by proposing a TTA framework based on storing maximally informative (D-optimal) statistics, which jointly enables stable adaptation and principled parameter selection at test time. When applied to pretrained simulation surrogates, our method yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvements at negligible computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic demonstration of effective TTA for high-dimensional simulation regression and generative design optimization, validated on the SIMSHIFT and EngiBench benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While these models can often give correct answers, users also need to know where those answers come from. In this work, we study structured data attribution/citation, which is the ability of the models to point to the specific rows and columns that support an answer. We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models. We also find that models are more reliable at citing rows than columns, and struggle more with textual formats than images. Finally, we observe notable differences across model families. Overall, our findings show that current mLLMs are unreliable at providing fine-grained, trustworthy attribution for structured data, which limits their usage in applications requiring transparency and traceability.</p></details> |  |

In practice, users iteratively refine visualizations through multi-turn interactions that require maintaining common ground, tracking prior edits, and adapting to evolving preferences. We introduce ChartEditBench, a benchmark for incremental, visually grounded chart editing via code, comprising 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a rigorously human-verified subset. Unlike prior one-shot benchmarks, ChartEditBench evaluates sustained, context-aware editing. We further propose a robust evaluation framework that mitigates limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge metrics by integrating execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification. Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations. ChartEditBench, establishes a challenging testbed for grounded, intent-aware multimodal programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures including Supplementary Material</p></details> |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a long-standing pillar problem in Web-scale systems and online infrastructures, such as service reliability monitoring, system fault diagnosis, and performance optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |
| **[Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving MLLMs in Embodied Exploration and Question Answering with Human-Inspired Memory Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15513v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Multimodal Large Language Models as the brain of embodied agents remains challenging, particularly under long-horizon observations and limited context budgets. Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Morphing Attack Detection in Open Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15461v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis.

| **[One Agent to Guide Them All: Empowering MLLMs for Vision-and-Language Navigation via Explicit World Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15400v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMemAgent: Hierarchical Event-Centric Memory for Online Video Understanding with Adaptive Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15329v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11858v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.</p></details> |  |

They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion. We introduce trajectory transformers as a proof-of-concept that ensemble-size independence can be achieved. This approach is an adaptation of the Post-processing Ensembles with Transformers (PoET) framework and applies self-attention over lead time while preserving the conditional independence required by aCRPS. When applied to weekly mean $T_{2m}$ forecasts from the ECMWF subseasonal forecasting system, this approach successfully reduces systematic model biases whilst also improving or maintaining forecast reliability regardless of the ensemble size used in training (3 vs 9 members) or real-time forecasts (9 vs 100 members).</p></details> |  |
| **[Dex4D: Task-Agnostic Point Track Policy for Sim-to-Real Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15828v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dex4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Hunt Globally: Wide Search AI Agents for Drug Asset Scouting in Investing, Business Development, and Competitive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15019v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests that over 85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total. A growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at 30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucination. We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real-deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. On this benchmark, our Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 score, outperforming Claude Opus 4.6 (56.2%), Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research (50.6%), OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro (46.6%), Perplexity Deep Research (44.2%), and Exa Websets (26.9%). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.</p></details> |  |
| **[stable-worldmodel-v1: Reproducible World Modeling Research and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08968v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World Models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning compact, predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling agents to reason, plan, and generalize beyond direct experience. Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computation and Size of Interpolants for Hybrid Modal Logics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15821v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has established complexity results for the problem of deciding the existence of interpolants in logics lacking the Craig Interpolation Property (CIP). The proof techniques developed so far are non-constructive, and no meaningful bounds on the size of interpolants are known. Hybrid modal logics (or modal logics with nominals) are a particularly interesting class of logics without CIP: in their case, CIP cannot be restored without sacrificing decidability and, in applications, interpolants in these logics can serve as definite descriptions and separators between positive and negative data examples in description logic knowledge bases. In this contribution we show, using a new hypermosaic elimination technique, that in many standard hybrid modal logics Craig interpolants can be computed in fourfold exponential time, if they exist. On the other hand, we show that the existence of uniform interpolants is undecidable, which is in stark contrast to modal or intuitionistic logic where uniform interpolants always exist.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoSketcher: Video Models Prior Enable Versatile Sequential Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15819v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Task-Agnostic Continual Learning for Chest Radiograph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15811v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
