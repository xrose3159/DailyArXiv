| **[LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic "filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections, presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data at https://filter.baulab.info/</p></details> |
| **[Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Massive Supervised Fine-tuning Experiments Reveal How Data, Layer, and Training Factors Shape LLM Alignment Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14681v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a critical step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human instructions and values, yet many aspects of SFT remain poorly understood. We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness, often surpassing superficial similarity between the training data and the benchmark, and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains. We release these 1,000+ SFT models and benchmark results to accelerate further research.

| **[Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems. Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation, as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemAscend: System Memory Optimization for SSD-Offloaded LLM Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23254v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the huge success of generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a core subclass, underpinning applications such as question answering, text generation, and code completion. While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and small organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak CPU usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, stifling scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak overhead, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with standard SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Analysis and Optimized CXL-Attached Memory Allocation for Long-Context LLM Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03305v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial memory requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for long-context fine-tuning, have renewed interest in CPU offloading to augment limited GPU memory. However, as context lengths grow, relying on CPU memory for intermediate states introduces a significant bottleneck that can exhaust the capacity of mainstream client platforms. To address this limitation, this work investigates the effectiveness of Compute Express Link (CXL) add-in card (AIC) memory as an extension to CPU memory, enabling larger model sizes and longer context lengths during fine-tuning. Extensive benchmarking reveals two critical challenges. First, current deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch lack fine-grained, per-tensor control over NUMA memory allocation, exposing only coarse, process-level policies. Second, due to this lack of control, when the memory footprint of fine-tuning is offloaded across local DRAM and CXL-attached memory, naively placing optimizer data in higher-latency CXL leads to substantial slowdowns in the optimizer step (e.g., 4x once data exceeds 20M elements). To overcome these challenges, this work introduces a PyTorch extension that enables tensor-level system memory control and a CXL-aware memory allocator that pins latency-critical tensors in local DRAM while maximizing bandwidth by striping latency-tolerant tensors across one or more CXL devices. Evaluated on a real hardware setup with 7B and 12B models, 4K-32K contexts, and a single GPU, our approach recovers throughput to 97-99% of DRAM-only with a single AIC and approximately 100% with two AICs, delivering up to 21% improvement over naive interleaving while preserving DRAM-like DMA bandwidth for GPU transfers. These results show that carefully managed CXL-attached memory is a practical path to scaling long-context fine-tuning beyond DRAM limits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Refine-n-Judge: Curating High-Quality Preference Chains for LLM-Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01543v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[All You Need for Object Detection: From Pixels, Points, and Prompts to Next-Gen Fusion and Multimodal LLMs/VLMs in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26641v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[WeaveRec: An LLM-Based Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation Framework with Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26546v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging. WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

| **[Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models. https://amo-bench.github.io/</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task. From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations. Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics, Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The 19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3 30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across architectural diversity. The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can Outperform Large-Scale Data Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20059v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling Thinking Speed in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03704v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System 1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-in module delivers an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[The Era of Agentic Organization: Learning to Organize with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26658v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Quest for Generalizable Motion Generation: Data, Model, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26794v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

| **[Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that the generalization ability of image diffusion models arises from the locality properties of the trained neural network. In particular, when denoising a particular pixel, the model relies on a limited neighborhood of the input image around that pixel, which, according to the previous work, is tightly related to the ability of these models to produce novel images. Since locality is central to generalization, it is crucial to understand why diffusion models learn local behavior in the first place, as well as the factors that govern the properties of locality patterns. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset and is not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, as suggested in previous work. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from pixel correlations present in the image datasets. Moreover, locality patterns are drastically different on specialized datasets, approximating principal components of the data's covariance. We use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than prior expert-crafted alternatives. Our key takeaway is that while neural network architectures influence generation quality, their primary role is to capture locality patterns inherent in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Partially-Supervised Neural Network Model For Quadratic Multiparametric Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05567v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN) architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers, the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for simulations and long term planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages including references and appendix</p></details> |
