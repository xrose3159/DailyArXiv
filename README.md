| **[Dataset Distillation for Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16674v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[EvoLMM: Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models with Continuous Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16672v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/EvoLMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 6 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[NoPo-Avatar: Generalizable and Animatable Avatars from Sparse Inputs without Human Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16673v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25; project page: https://wenj.github.io/NoPo-Avatar/</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Think Fast and Slow for Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16670v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16669v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-as-answer.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SceneDesigner: Controllable Multi-Object Image Generation with 9-DoF Pose Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16666v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/FudanCVL/SceneDesigner.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight), Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/SceneDesigner/</p></details> |
| **[Dexterity from Smart Lenses: Multi-Fingered Robot Manipulation with In-the-Wild Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16661v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

| **[Enhancing Forex Forecasting Accuracy: The Impact of Hybrid Variable Sets in Cognitive Algorithmic Trading Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16657v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.</p></details> | Paper not published |

| **[Taming the Long-Tail: Efficient Reasoning RL Training with Adaptive Drafter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16665v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nemotron Elastic: Towards Efficient Many-in-One Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16664v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.</p></details> |  |

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[You Only Forward Once: An Efficient Compositional Judging Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16600v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15552v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conan: Progressive Learning to Reason Like a Detective over Multi-Scale Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20470v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding, yet still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these limitations, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning. Conan identifies context and evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further. To achieve this, we 1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces that include frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and 2) design a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to progressively incentivize multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to long video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-MLLM: Vector Quantization for Robust Multimodal Large Language Model Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16229v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

| **[Can MLLMs Read the Room? A Multimodal Benchmark for Assessing Deception in Multi-Party Social Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16221v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video2Layout: Recall and Reconstruct Metric-Grounded Cognitive Map for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16160v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ybrrraway/Video2Layout.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Guided Embeddings: Leveraging MLLM Reasoning for Improved Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16150v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Multimodal Unified Reasoning Model via Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08987v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, large model size and overthinking. However, existing lightweight MLLMs lack the capability to balance high efficiency and performance at a small scale. To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks with fewer inference tokens. In the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a new reinforcement learning method, to train each reasoning model, including mathematical reasoning, chart reasoning, and OCR capability. The LIPO dynamically adjusts the advantages of responses within groups by prioritizing concise yet high-quality responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate responses. In the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors via a novel gradient projection regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them. Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

| **[Revisiting Model Inversion Evaluation: From Misleading Standards to Reliable Privacy Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03519v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to reconstruct information from private training data by exploiting access to machine learning models T. To evaluate such attacks, the standard evaluation framework relies on an evaluation model E, trained under the same task design as T. This framework has become the de facto standard for assessing progress in MI research, used across nearly all recent MI studies without question. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of this evaluation framework. In particular, we identify a critical issue of this standard framework: Type-I adversarial examples. These are reconstructions that do not capture the visual features of private training data, yet are still deemed successful by T and ultimately transferable to E. Such false positives undermine the reliability of the standard MI evaluation framework. To address this issue, we introduce a new MI evaluation framework that replaces the evaluation model E with advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By leveraging their general-purpose visual understanding, our MLLM-based framework does not depend on training of shared task design as in T, thus reducing Type-I transferability and providing more faithful assessments of reconstruction success. Using our MLLM-based evaluation framework, we reevaluate 27 diverse MI attack setups and empirically reveal consistently high false positive rates under the standard evaluation framework. Importantly, we demonstrate that many state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI methods report inflated attack accuracy, indicating that actual privacy leakage is significantly lower than previously believed. By uncovering this critical issue and proposing a robust solution, our work enables a reassessment of progress in MI research and sets a new standard for reliable and robust evaluation.

| **[Dataset Distillation for Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16674v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[EvoLMM: Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models with Continuous Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16672v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/EvoLMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 6 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25; project page: https://wenj.github.io/NoPo-Avatar/</p></details> |
| **[Thinking-while-Generating: Interleaving Textual Reasoning throughout Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16671v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

| **[Learning to Think Fast and Slow for Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16670v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16669v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-as-answer.github.io/</p></details> |

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

| **[Dexterity from Smart Lenses: Multi-Fingered Robot Manipulation with In-the-Wild Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16661v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks. Robot rollouts are best viewed on our website: https://aina-robot.github.io.</p></details> |  |
