| **[RUST-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Reasoning on Unstructured Text within Structured Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04491v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.</p></details> |  |

We present a tool that integrates synthetic data generation into the LLM-as-a-judge workflow, empowering users to create tailored and challenging test cases with configurable domains, personas, lengths, and desired outcomes, including borderline cases. The tool also supports AI-assisted inline editing of existing test cases. To enhance transparency and interpretability, it reveals the prompts and explanations behind each generation. In a user study (N=24), 83% of participants preferred the tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to rapidly generate diverse synthetic data without additional workload. The generated synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data for both refining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences. These findings highlight synthetic data as a promising alternative, particularly in contexts where efficiency and scalability are critical.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |

This paper presents two complementary efforts at Vectara to measure and benchmark LLM faithfulness in RAG. First, we describe our original hallucination leaderboard, which has tracked hallucination rates for LLMs since 2023 using our HHEM hallucination detection model. Motivated by limitations observed in current hallucination detection methods, we introduce FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge framework that leverages a pool of diverse human-annotated hallucination examples to substantially improve the automated hallucination evaluation of LLMs. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge that benchmarks LLMs on RAG faithfulness in summarization, question-answering, and data-to-text generation tasks. FaithJudge enables a more reliable benchmarking of LLM hallucinations in RAG and supports the development of more trustworthy generative AI systems: https://github.com/vectara/FaithJudge.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Industry Track 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ground-Truth Subgraphs for Better Training and Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04473v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval. We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM-Contaminated Crowdsourcing Data Without Ground Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06991v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimensional training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |
| **[The Illusion of Certainty: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs fails under ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model, and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of current modeling paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Do LLMs Still Struggle? An In-Depth Analysis of Code Generation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04355v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular, offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track</p></details> |
| **[Test smells in LLM-Generated Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10628v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs promise to transform unit test generation from a manual burden into an automated solution. Yet, beyond metrics such as compilability or coverage, little is known about the quality of LLM-generated tests, particularly their susceptibility to test smells, design flaws that undermine readability and maintainability. This paper presents the first multi-benchmark, large-scale analysis of test smell diffusion in LLM-generated unit tests. We contrast LLM outputs with human-written suites (as the reference for real-world practices) and SBST-generated tests from EvoSuite (as the automated baseline), disentangling whether LLMs reproduce human-like flaws or artifacts of synthetic generation. Our study draws on 20,505 class-level suites from four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B), 972 method-level cases from TestBench, 14,469 EvoSuite tests, and 779,585 human-written tests from 34,635 open-source Java projects. Using two complementary detection tools (TsDetect and JNose), we analyze prevalence, co-occurrence, and correlations with software attributes and generation parameters. Results show that LLM-generated tests consistently manifest smells such as Assertion Roulette and Magic Number Test, with patterns strongly influenced by prompting strategy, context length, and model scale. Comparisons reveal overlaps with human-written tests, raising concerns of potential data leakage from training corpora while EvoSuite exhibits distinct, generator-specific flaws. These findings highlight both the promise and the risks of LLM-based test generation, and call for the design of smell-aware generation frameworks, prompt engineering strategies, and enhanced detection tools to ensure maintainable, high-quality test code.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOTS: A Unified Framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM Reinforcement Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26374v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training. Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce BOTS, a unified framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching LLMs to See and Guide: Context-Aware Real-Time Assistance in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00730v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) technologies in industrial training and on-the-job assistance has created new opportunities for intelligent, context-aware support systems. As workers perform complex tasks guided by AR and VR, these devices capture rich streams of multimodal data, including gaze, hand actions, and task progression, that can reveal user intent and task state in real time. Leveraging this information effectively remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a context-aware large language model (LLM) assistant that integrates diverse data modalities, such as hand actions, task steps, and dialogue history, into a unified framework for real-time question answering. To systematically study how context influences performance, we introduce an incremental prompting framework, where each model version receives progressively richer contextual inputs. Using the HoloAssist dataset, which records AR-guided task executions, we evaluate how each modality contributes to the assistant's effectiveness. Our experiments show that incorporating multimodal context significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of responses. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven multimodal integration to enable adaptive, intuitive assistance for AR and VR-based industrial training and assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is intended for submission to the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems for possible publication</p></details> |

| **[DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act. By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence, Characteristics, and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08604v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |

We investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are language models aware of the road not taken? Token-level uncertainty and hidden state dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04527v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Clinical Uncertainty in Radiology Reports: from Explicit Uncertainty Markers to Implicit Reasoning Pathways](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04506v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats. These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated, LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for 14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded, uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 17 figures, 15 tables, GitHub repository: https://github.com/EstelYang/QCircuitBench</p></details> |

Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</p></details> | <details><summary>EurIP...</summary><p>EurIPS 2025 Workshop Causality for Impact: Practical challenges for real-world applications of causal methods</p></details> |
| **[ChessArena: A Chess Testbed for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24239v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities. However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance, approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

This omission may contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences (from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To-be...</summary><p>To-be presented at the Workshop on the Foundations of Reasoning in Language Models at NeurIPS 2025 (non-archival)</p></details> |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to conventional event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth, consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a modeling and control design framework for hybrid power plants (HPPs) consisting of a wind farm, solar plant, and battery storage. Specifically, this work adapts established modeling paradigms for wind farms, solar plants and battery models into a control affine form suitable for control design at the supervisory level. In the case of wind and battery models, generator torque and cell current control laws are developed using nonlinear control and control barrier function techniques to track a command from a supervisory control law while maintaining safe and stable operation. The utility of this modeling and control framework is illustrated through a test case using a utility demand signal for tracking, time varying wind and irradiance data, and a rule-based supervisory control law.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence, Characteristics, and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08604v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |

We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC 0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers, enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on CauScien: Uncovering Causality in Science</p></details> |
| **[DashCLIP: Leveraging multimodal models for generating semantic embeddings for DoorDash](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks, obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset, eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications, including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics. We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the AI for Tabular Data workshop at EurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ARETE: an R package for Automated REtrieval from TExt with large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04573v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore, researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available bibliographic data during project planning.</p></details> |  |
