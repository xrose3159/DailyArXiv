| **[Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages.

| **[DiffusionBrowser: Interactive Diffusion Previews via Multi-Branch Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13690v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://susunghong.github.io/DiffusionBrowser</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Video Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13684v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feedforward 3D Editing via Text-Steerable Image-to-3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13678v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries.

This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (including appendix), 7 figures.

| **[Template-Guided Reconstruction of Pulmonary Segments with Neural Implicit Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08919v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 3D reconstruction of pulmonary segments plays a crucial role in segmentectomy and surgical planning for the treatment of lung cancer. Due to the resolution requirement of the target reconstruction, conventional deep learning-based methods often suffer from computational resource constraints or limited granularity. Conversely, implicit modeling is favored due to its computational efficiency and continuous representation at any resolution. We propose a neural implicit function-based method to learn a 3D surface to achieve anatomy-aware, precise pulmonary segment reconstruction, represented as a shape by deforming a learnable template. Additionally, we introduce two clinically relevant evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess the quality of the reconstruction. Furthermore, to address the lack of publicly available shape datasets for benchmarking reconstruction algorithms, we developed a shape dataset named Lung3D, which includes the 3D models of 800 labeled pulmonary segments and their corresponding airways, arteries, veins, and intersegmental veins. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, providing a new perspective for pulmonary segment reconstruction. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/HINTLab/ImPulSe.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Medical Image Analysis, 2025</p></details> |

| **[AgentIAD: Tool-Augmented Single-Agent for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13671v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is difficult due to the scarcity of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of many defects. Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We propose AgentIAD, a tool-driven agentic framework that enables multi-stage visual inspection. The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMhops-R1: Multimodal Multi-hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13573v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.</p></details> | Acceped by AAAI 2026 |
| **[TARA: Simple and Efficient Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation of MLLMs for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13511v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our objective is to build a general time-aware video-text embedding model for retrieval. To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

| **[HumanSense: From Multimodal Perception to Empathetic Context-Aware Responses through Reasoning MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10576v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.Furthermore, grounded in the observation that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, we posit that reasoning ability serves as the key to unlocking it. We devise a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning approach, resulting in HumanSense-Omni-Reasoning, which substantially enhances performance on higher-level understanding and interactive tasks. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes appear to exhibit consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.Project page: \textcolor{brightpink}{https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/HumanSense/}</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |

To push beyond the existing limitations, we introduce a new and challenging task: creative table visualization, requiring the model to generate an infographic that faithfully and aesthetically visualizes the data from a given table. To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results. To support this task and our pipeline, we introduce three automated data construction pipelines for training different modules. Furthermore, we introduce TableVisBench, a new benchmark with 800 challenging instances across 5 evaluation dimensions, to assess performance on this task. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline, instantiated with different models, significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effective multi-modal reasoning, generation, and error correction capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://lntzm.github.io/showtable-page/</p></details> |
| **[ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12793v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs. In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when handling non-annotated charts. We argue that current MLLMs rely largely on visual recognition rather than visual reasoning to interpret the charts, and visual estimation of numerical values is one of the most fundamental capabilities in chart understanding that require complex visual reasoning. To prove this, we introduce ChartVRBench, a benchmark meticulously designed to isolate and evaluate visual reasoning ability in chart understanding. Furthermore, we propose ChartVR-3B/7B trained with a novel Visual Reasoning Reinforcement Finetuning (VR-RFT) strategy to strengthen genuine chart visual reasoning abilities. Extensive experiments show that ChartVR achieves superior performance on ChartVRBench, outperforming even powerful proprietary models. Moreover, the visual reasoning skills cultivated by the proposed VR-RFT demonstrate strong generalization, leading to significant performance gains across a diverse suite of public chart understanding benchmarks. The code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate spurious bias in MLLMs and introduce SpurLens, a pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and open-set object detectors to automatically identify spurious visual cues without human supervision. Our findings reveal that spurious correlations cause two major failure modes in MLLMs: (1) over-reliance on spurious cues for object recognition, where removing these cues reduces accuracy, and (2) object hallucination, where spurious cues amplify the hallucination by over 10x. We validate our findings in various MLLMs and datasets. Beyond diagnosing these failures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling and reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root causes of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious correlations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking with Visual Abstract: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning via Visual Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20164v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant information, which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive strategy, we introduce a novel paradigm to elicit the ability to Think with Visual Abstract (VAT), by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting a more efficient visual reasoning mechanism via concentrated perception. VAT encourages models to focus on more essential visual elements, concepts and structural features by undermining redundant information compared with explicit thinking methods, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) and tool-using approaches, that increase the complexity of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps and external knowledge. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers different MLLMs in visual perception and reasoning tasks. VAT achieves an average gain of $2.21\%$ over GPT-5 baseline, surpassing the gain of CoT, demonstrating that VAT better enhances multimodal task performance of MLLMs. Additionally, VAT spends fewer tokens while achieving higher performance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of visual abstract thinking and encourage further exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human cognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrivePI: Spatial-aware 4D MLLM for Unified Autonomous Driving Understanding, Perception, Prediction and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12799v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application in generating fine-grained 3D perception and prediction outputs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

| **[Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5+4 p...</summary><p>5+4 pages.

| **[Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Video Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13684v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feedforward 3D Editing via Text-Steerable Image-to-3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13678v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

| **[Towards Effective Model Editing for LLM Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13676v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization is becoming indispensable for LLMs to align with individual user preferences and needs. Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (including appendix), 7 figures.

| **[Template-Guided Reconstruction of Pulmonary Segments with Neural Implicit Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08919v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 3D reconstruction of pulmonary segments plays a crucial role in segmentectomy and surgical planning for the treatment of lung cancer. Due to the resolution requirement of the target reconstruction, conventional deep learning-based methods often suffer from computational resource constraints or limited granularity. Conversely, implicit modeling is favored due to its computational efficiency and continuous representation at any resolution. We propose a neural implicit function-based method to learn a 3D surface to achieve anatomy-aware, precise pulmonary segment reconstruction, represented as a shape by deforming a learnable template. Additionally, we introduce two clinically relevant evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess the quality of the reconstruction. Furthermore, to address the lack of publicly available shape datasets for benchmarking reconstruction algorithms, we developed a shape dataset named Lung3D, which includes the 3D models of 800 labeled pulmonary segments and their corresponding airways, arteries, veins, and intersegmental veins. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, providing a new perspective for pulmonary segment reconstruction.
