Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies, ISAECT 2025</p></details> |
| **[FREESH: Fair, Resource- and Energy-Efficient Scheduling for LLM Serving on Heterogeneous GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00807v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing computation and energy demand for LLM and AI agents call for holistic and efficient optimization of LLM serving systems. In practice, heterogeneous GPU clusters can be deployed in a geographically distributed manner, while LLM load also observes diversity in terms of both query traffic and serving patterns. LLM queries running on advanced GPUs during a high-emission hour at one location can lead to significantly higher carbon footprints versus same queries running on mid-level GPUs at a low-emission time and location. By observing LLM serving requirements and leveraging spatiotemporal computation flexibility, we consider the joint routing and scheduling problem, and propose FREESH to cooperatively run a group of data centers while minimizing user-specified carbon or energy objectives. FREESH identifies the optimal configurations of balanced load serving by matching distinct GPU instance's power-throughput characteristics with predictable LLM query length and workloads. To ensure both latency and fairness requirements, FREESH identifies optimized parallelism and query routing schedules together with dynamic GPU frequency scaling for power saving, and Least-Laxity-First (LLF) serving strategy for query scheduling. During the 1-hour serving on production workloads, FREESH reduces energy by 28.6% and emissions by 45.45% together with improvements in SLO attainment and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Su...</summary><p>In Submission, code available at https://github.com/AndrewFangZequan/LLM_Serving_FREESH</p></details> |
| **[LLM Query Scheduling with Prefix Reuse and Latency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04677v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in online settings requires optimizing inference performance under stringent latency constraints, particularly the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT). This paper focuses on the query scheduling problem for LLM inference with prefix reuse, a technique that leverages shared prefixes across queries to reduce computational overhead. Our work reveals previously unknown limitations of the existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and longest-prefix-match (LPM) scheduling strategies with respect to satisfying latency constraints. We present a formal theoretical framework for LLM query scheduling under RadixAttention, a prefix reuse mechanism that stores and reuses intermediate representations in a radix tree structure. Our analysis establishes the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem with prefix reuse under TTFT constraints and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm, $k$-LPM, which generalizes existing methods by balancing prefix reuse and fairness in query processing. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that $k$-LPM achieves improved TTFT performance under realistic traffic patterns captured by a data generative model. Empirical evaluations in a realistic serving setting validates our findings, showing significant reductions in P99 TTFT compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

In this perspective paper, we introduce a structured, multi-phased framework, "SME-TEAM" for the secure and responsible use of these technologies in SMEs. Based on a conceptual structure of four key pillars, i.e., Data, Algorithms, Human Oversight, and Model Architecture, SME-TEAM bridges theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI capabilities across a wide range of applications in SMEs. Ultimately, this paper provides a structured roadmap for the adoption of these emerging technologies, positioning trust and ethics as a driving force for resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation within the area of business analytics and SMEs.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[TabGemma: Text-Based Tabular ICL via LLM using Continued Pretraining and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03570v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed text, numeric, and categorical fields. We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit within a 128k-token window. On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Battle After Another: Probing LLMs' Limits on Multi-Turn Instruction Following with a Benchmark Evolving Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03508v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints, instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types. Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code will be made publicly available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

Mono- and Bi-lingual Data, Multilingual Evaluation, and Pre-Trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01066v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an ongoing initiative to provide open, very large, high-quality, and richly annotated textual datasets for almost 200 languages. At 30 trillion tokens, this is likely the largest generally available multilingual collection of LLM pre-training data. These datasets are derived from web crawls from different sources and accompanied with a complete, open-source pipeline for document selection from web archives, text extraction from HTML, language identification for noisy texts, exact and near-deduplication, annotation with, among others, register labels, text quality estimates, and personally identifiable information; and final selection and filtering. We report on data quality probes through contrastive and analytical statistics, through manual inspection of samples for 24 languages, and through end-to-end evaluation of various language model architectures trained on this data. For multilingual LLM evaluation, we provide a comprehensive collection of benchmarks for nine European languages, with special emphasis on natively created tasks, mechanisms to mitigate prompt sensitivity, and refined normalization and aggregation of scores. Additionally, we train and evaluate a family of 57 monolingual encoder-decoder models, as well as a handful of monolingual GPT-like reference models. Besides the monolingual data and models, we also present a very large collection of parallel texts automatically mined from this data, together with a novel parallel corpus synthesized via machine translation.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, presented at the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education Technology</p></details> |
| **[IndicSuperTokenizer: An Optimized Tokenizer for Indic Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03237v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data, our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by 18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design choices.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large Model Token Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21600v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

| **[Hulu-Med: A Transparent Generalist Model towards Holistic Medical Vision-Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08668v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world clinical decision-making requires integrating heterogeneous data, including medical text, 2D images, 3D volumes, and videos, while existing AI systems fail to unify all these signals, limiting their utility. In this paper, we introduce Hulu-Med, a transparent, generalist medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to unify language-only, 2D/3D vision-language, and video understanding within a single architecture. Hulu-Med is trained on a curated corpus of 16.7 million samples, comprising exclusively public or synthetic data, spanning 12 major anatomical systems and 14 medical imaging modalities. Hulu-Med employs a medical-aware token-reduction strategy that prunes redundant visual tokens, achieving up to a 55% reduction for 3D and video inputs, improving cross-modal efficiency, and enabling training at 7B-32B parameter scales in approximately 4,000-40,000 GPU hours. Across 30 public in-domain and out-of-domain medical benchmarks-covering text reasoning, visual question answering, report generation, multilingual dialogue, video understanding, and rare disease diagnosis-Hulu-Med surpasses existing open-source models on 27 of 30 benchmarks and outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o on 16 benchmarks. Despite being a VLM, Hulu-Med outperforms GPT-4o and matches GPT-o1 on the text-only HealthBench. For the first time in the community, we provide a fully transparent, reproducible and cost-effective pipeline for holistic medical vision-language understanding by releasing our end-to-end data curation, training procedures, and model parameters. Code and models are available at https://github.com/ZJUI-AI4H/Hulu-Med.</p></details> |  |

One proposed strategy is decomposition, which breaks down complex visualizations into structured components. In this work, we examine the efficacy of scalable vector graphics (SVGs) as a decomposition strategy for improving LMMs' performance on floor plans comprehension. Floor plans serve as a valuable testbed because they combine geometry, topology, and semantics, and their reliable comprehension has real-world applications, such as accessibility for blind and low-vision individuals. We conducted an exploratory study with three LMMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct) across 75 floor plans. Results show that combining SVG with raster input (SVG+PNG) improves performance on spatial understanding tasks but often hinders spatial reasoning, particularly in pathfinding. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of decomposition as a strategy for advancing spatial visualization comprehension.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[AnalogSeeker: An Open-source Foundation Language Model for Analog Circuit Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10409v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark, with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17612v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a fundamental challenge in molecular science. Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</p></details> |  |

Small language models (SLMs), with compact, efficient, and adaptable features, offer promising solutions. Building on this potential, recent research explores collaborative frameworks that integrate their complementary strengths, leveraging SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs' generalization and reasoning to address diverse objectives across tasks and deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration from the perspective of collaboration objectives. We propose a taxonomy covering four goals: performance enhancement, cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Under this framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient and secure SLM-LLM collaboration. The collected papers are available at https://github.com/FairyFali/SLMs-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 19 figures-under review; more detailed than v1</p></details> |

In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics, health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5, Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only $45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$) and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make, highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance, physics, health, and statistics.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies, ISAECT 2025</p></details> |

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The library is open source and available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune</p></details> |
| **[Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis I: Methodology and implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03667v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex inference tasks, such as those encountered in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, rely on Bayesian frameworks. The high-dimensional parameter space and the strong interdependencies among astrophysical, pulsar noise, and nuisance parameters introduce significant challenges for efficient learning and robust inference. These challenges are emblematic of broader issues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior sensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability of the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach employs Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing hierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based mappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the tractability to preserve proper probability densities. We further adopt i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to accelerate exploration of complex posteriors. This unified use of NFs improves statistical robustness and computational efficiency, providing a principled methodology for addressing hierarchical Bayesian inference in PTA analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. By conducting a series of scaling experiments, we identify UniChem as the informative molecular database for pre-training the foundation model. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as a foundation model, ChemFM exhibits strong data efficiency, requiring significantly fewer labeled training samples to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiveTradeBench: Seeking Real-World Alpha with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03628v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across benchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but these tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty. Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[R2R: Efficiently Navigating Divergent Reasoning Paths with Small-Large Model Token Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21600v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

| **[TABLET: A Large-Scale Dataset for Robust Visual Table Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21205v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.</p></details> |  |
