| **[Imitating What Works: Simulation-Filtered Modular Policy Learning from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13197v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn manipulation skills by watching videos of humans has the potential to unlock a new source of highly scalable data for robot learning. Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conversational Image Segmentation: Grounding Abstract Concepts with Scalable Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13195v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational image segmentation grounds abstract, intent-driven concepts into pixel-accurate masks. Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., "left-most apple") and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., "where can I safely store the knife?"). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and ConverSeg, a benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present ConverSeg-Net, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates prompt-mask pairs without human supervision. We show that current language-guided segmentation models are inadequate for CIS, while ConverSeg-Net trained on our data engine achieves significant gains on ConverSeg and maintains strong performance on existing language-guided segmentation benchmarks.

| **[R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-parametric finite-sample credible intervals with one-dimensional priors: a middle ground between Bayesian and frequentist intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17621v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new type of statistical interval obtained by weakening the definition of a p% credible interval: After observing the interval, but not inspecting the full dataset ourselves, we should put at least a p% belief in it. From a decision-theoretical point of view the resulting intervals occupy a middle ground between frequentist and fully Bayesian statistical intervals, both practically and philosophically: To a p% Bayesian credible interval we should assign (at least a) p% belief after observing both the dataset and the interval, while p% frequentist intervals we can in general only assign a p% belief before seeing either the data or the interval. We derive concrete implementations for two cases: estimation of the fraction of a distribution that falls below a certain value (i.e., the CDF), and of the mean of a distribution with bounded support. Even though the problems are fully non-parametric, these methods require only one-dimensional priors. They share many of the practical advantages of Bayesian methods while avoiding the complexity of assigning high-dimensional priors altogether. Asymptotically they give intervals equivalent to the fully Bayesian approach and somewhat wider intervals, respectively. We discuss promising directions where the proposed type of interval may provide significant advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Profiling systematic uncertainties in Simulation-Based Inference with Factorizable Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13184v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unbinned likelihood fits aim at maximizing the information one can extract from experimental data, yet their application in realistic statistical analyses is often hindered by the computational cost of profiling systematic uncertainties. Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Anytime-Valid Inference in Adaptive Experiments: Covariate Adjustment and Balanced Power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20523v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive experiments such as multi-armed bandits offer efficiency gains over traditional randomized experiments but pose two major challenges: invalid inference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) due to adaptive sampling and low statistical power for sub-optimal treatments. We address both issues by extending the Mixture Adaptive Design framework (arXiv:2311.05794). First, we propose MADCovar, a covariate-adjusted ATE estimator that is unbiased and preserves anytime-valid inference guarantees while substantially improving ATE precision. Second, we introduce MADMod, which dynamically reallocates samples to underpowered arms, enabling more balanced statistical power across treatments without sacrificing valid inference. Both methods retain MAD's core advantage of constructing asymptotic confidence sequences (CSs) that allow researchers to continuously monitor ATE estimates and stop data collection once a desired precision or significance criterion is met. Empirically, we validate both methods using simulations and real-world data. In simulations, MADCovar reduces CS width by up to 60% relative to MAD. In a large-scale political RCT with 32,000 participants, MADCovar achieves similar precision gains. MADMod improves statistical power and inferential precision across all treatment arms, particularly for suboptimal treatments. Simulations show that MADMod sharply reduces Type II error while preserving the efficiency benefits of adaptive allocation. Together, MADCovar and MADMod make adaptive experiments more practical, reliable, and efficient for applied researchers across many domains. Our proposed methods are implemented through an open-source software package.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Selection of CMIP6 Models for Regional Precipitation Projection and Climate Change Assessment in the Jhelum and Chenab River Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13181v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective water resource management depends on accurate projections of flows in water channels. For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Verifiable Fairness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12447v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed institutions without centralizing sensitive data; however, ensuring algorithmic fairness across heterogeneous data distributions while preserving privacy remains fundamentally unresolved. This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \log n) while maintaining (\dparam, \deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations. These results establish a practical pathway for deploying fairness-aware federated learning in regulated industries requiring both privacy protection and algorithmic accountability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fix Before Search: Benchmarking Agentic Query Visual Pre-processing in Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13179v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a key paradigm for grounding MLLMs with external knowledge. While query pre-processing (e.g., rewriting) is standard in text-based RAG, existing MRAG pipelines predominantly treat visual inputs as static and immutable, implicitly assuming they are noise-free. However, real-world visual queries are often ``imperfect'' -- suffering from geometric distortions, quality degradation, or semantic ambiguity -- leading to catastrophic retrieval failures. To address this gap, we propose V-QPP-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to Visual Query Pre-processing (V-QPP). We formulate V-QPP as an agentic decision-making task where MLLMs must autonomously diagnose imperfections and deploy perceptual tools to refine queries. Our extensive evaluation across 46,700 imperfect queries and diverse MRAG paradigms reveals three critical insights: (1) Vulnerability -- visual imperfections severely degrade both retrieval recall and end-to-end MRAG performance; (2) Restoration Potential \& Bottleneck -- while oracle preprocessing recovers near-perfect performance, off-the-shelf MLLMs struggle with tool selection and parameter prediction without specialized training; and (3) Training Enhancement -- supervised fine-tuning enables compact models to achieve comparable or superior performance to larger proprietary models, demonstrating the benchmark's value for developing robust MRAG systems The code is available at https://github.com/phycholosogy/VQQP_Bench</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned MLLM Judges for Fine-Grained Image Editing Evaluation: A Benchmark, Framework, and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13028v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating image editing models remains challenging due to the coarse granularity and limited interpretability of traditional metrics, which often fail to capture aspects important to human perception and intent. Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Universal Video MLLMs with Attribute-Structured and Quality-Verified Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13013v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal video understanding requires modeling fine-grained visual and audio information over time in diverse real-world scenarios. However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by video-instruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with single- and multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, a scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, a video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and is competitive with Gemini-3-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://asid-caption.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing MLLMs on the Edge: A Unified Framework for Cross-Modal ReID via Adaptive SVD Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12936v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical cloud-edge deployment of Cross-Modal Re-identification (CM-ReID) faces challenges due to maintaining a fragmented ecosystem of specialized cloud models for diverse modalities. While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices. The code and models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution by Jie Li</p></details> |
| **[Reliable Thinking with Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12916v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a multimodal extension of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Thinking with Images (TWI) has recently emerged as a promising avenue to enhance the reasoning capability of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which generates interleaved CoT by incorporating visual cues into the textual reasoning process. However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT.</p></details> | 26 pages, 19 figures |
| **[RADAR: Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12892v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) provide a knowledge-rich foundation for post-training by leveraging their inherent perception and reasoning capabilities to solve complex tasks. However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Nieysh/RADAR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping MLLM for Weakly-Supervised Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12774v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting is a fundamental task in computer vision, with broad applicability in many real-world scenarios. Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

| **[MLLM-CTBench: A Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning with Reasoning Process Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual instruction tuning(CIT) during the post-training phase is crucial for adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to evolving real-world demands. However, the progress is hampered by the lack of benchmarks with rigorous, protocol-consistent evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive benchmark for CIT of MLLMs, covering seven challenging tasks across six diverse domains. MLLM-CTBench makes three key contributions. First, we establish a multidimensional evaluation framework that jointly assesses final-answer accuracy and process-level reasoning quality, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces serve as an observable signal to diagnose catastrophic forgetting beyond answer-only evaluation. Second, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of continual learning methods by systematically assessing eight representative algorithms from four major families under a unified protocol across task orders, providing actionable insights for algorithm design. Third, we expand the scope from Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in CIT. By investigating GRPO, an on-policy RL algorithm that stabilizes updates through explicit KL-divergence control to a prior policy, we aim to analyze how this mechanism affects cross-task knowledge retention. Our experiments yield several findings:(1) Process-level reasoning quality is often more resilient to catastrophic forgetting than final-answer accuracy, and forgetting is primarily driven by degradation in domain knowledge. (2) Model capability is critical factor influencing continual learning outcomes, with stronger baseline models exhibiting greater resistance to catastrophic forgetting. (3) On-policy RFT (GRPO), with its inherent KL control, achieves more stable cross-task retention than SFT. While removing KL control can amplify forgetting despite potential gains on new ones.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03262v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully, and sometimes even improves, when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoder s marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe: (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90 percent, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16 percent higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6 percent overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90 percent of baseline on most non OCR tasks with substantially lower training resources and inference latency. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR2026, project website: https://github.com/MaoSong2022/Encoder-Redundancy</p></details> |

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conversational Image Segmentation: Grounding Abstract Concepts with Scalable Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13195v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational image segmentation grounds abstract, intent-driven concepts into pixel-accurate masks. Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., "left-most apple") and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., "where can I safely store the knife?"). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and ConverSeg, a benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present ConverSeg-Net, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates prompt-mask pairs without human supervision. We show that current language-guided segmentation models are inadequate for CIS, while ConverSeg-Net trained on our data engine achieves significant gains on ConverSeg and maintains strong performance on existing language-guided segmentation benchmarks.

| **[R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-parametric finite-sample credible intervals with one-dimensional priors: a middle ground between Bayesian and frequentist intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17621v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new type of statistical interval obtained by weakening the definition of a p% credible interval: After observing the interval, but not inspecting the full dataset ourselves, we should put at least a p% belief in it. From a decision-theoretical point of view the resulting intervals occupy a middle ground between frequentist and fully Bayesian statistical intervals, both practically and philosophically: To a p% Bayesian credible interval we should assign (at least a) p% belief after observing both the dataset and the interval, while p% frequentist intervals we can in general only assign a p% belief before seeing either the data or the interval. We derive concrete implementations for two cases: estimation of the fraction of a distribution that falls below a certain value (i.e., the CDF), and of the mean of a distribution with bounded support. Even though the problems are fully non-parametric, these methods require only one-dimensional priors. They share many of the practical advantages of Bayesian methods while avoiding the complexity of assigning high-dimensional priors altogether. Asymptotically they give intervals equivalent to the fully Bayesian approach and somewhat wider intervals, respectively. We discuss promising directions where the proposed type of interval may provide significant advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Profiling systematic uncertainties in Simulation-Based Inference with Factorizable Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13184v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unbinned likelihood fits aim at maximizing the information one can extract from experimental data, yet their application in realistic statistical analyses is often hindered by the computational cost of profiling systematic uncertainties. Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Anytime-Valid Inference in Adaptive Experiments: Covariate Adjustment and Balanced Power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20523v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive experiments such as multi-armed bandits offer efficiency gains over traditional randomized experiments but pose two major challenges: invalid inference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) due to adaptive sampling and low statistical power for sub-optimal treatments. We address both issues by extending the Mixture Adaptive Design framework (arXiv:2311.05794). First, we propose MADCovar, a covariate-adjusted ATE estimator that is unbiased and preserves anytime-valid inference guarantees while substantially improving ATE precision. Second, we introduce MADMod, which dynamically reallocates samples to underpowered arms, enabling more balanced statistical power across treatments without sacrificing valid inference. Both methods retain MAD's core advantage of constructing asymptotic confidence sequences (CSs) that allow researchers to continuously monitor ATE estimates and stop data collection once a desired precision or significance criterion is met. Empirically, we validate both methods using simulations and real-world data. In simulations, MADCovar reduces CS width by up to 60% relative to MAD. In a large-scale political RCT with 32,000 participants, MADCovar achieves similar precision gains. MADMod improves statistical power and inferential precision across all treatment arms, particularly for suboptimal treatments. Simulations show that MADMod sharply reduces Type II error while preserving the efficiency benefits of adaptive allocation. Together, MADCovar and MADMod make adaptive experiments more practical, reliable, and efficient for applied researchers across many domains. Our proposed methods are implemented through an open-source software package.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Verifiable Fairness Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12447v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed institutions without centralizing sensitive data; however, ensuring algorithmic fairness across heterogeneous data distributions while preserving privacy remains fundamentally unresolved. This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \log n) while maintaining (\dparam, \deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations. These results establish a practical pathway for deploying fairness-aware federated learning in regulated industries requiring both privacy protection and algorithmic accountability.</p></details> |  |
