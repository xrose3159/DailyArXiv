| **[Embedding Autonomous Agents in Resource-Constrained Robotic Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04191v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an open-access, author-archived version of a manuscript published in European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[Transforming Video Subjective Testing with Training, Engagement, and Real-Time Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04184v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subjective video quality assessment is crucial for optimizing streaming and compression, yet traditional protocols face limitations in capturing nuanced perceptual differences and ensuring reliable user input. We propose an integrated framework that enhances rater training, enforces attention through real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons to recover quality scores with fewer comparisons. Participants first undergo an automated training quiz to learn key video quality indicators (e.g., compression artifacts) and verify their readiness. During the test, a real-time attention scoring mechanism, using "golden" video pairs, monitors and reinforces rater focus by applying penalties for lapses. An efficient chain-based pairwise comparison procedure is then employed, yielding quality scores in Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD) units. Experiments comparing three groups (no training, training without feedback, and training with feedback) with 80 participants demonstrate that training-quiz significantly improves data quality in terms of golden unit accuracy and reduces tie rate, while real-time feedback further improves data quality and yields the most monotonic quality ratings. The new training, quiz, testing with feedback, 3-phase approach can significantly reduce the non-monotonic cases on the high quality part of the R-Q curve where normal viewer typically prefer the slightly compressed less-grainy content and help train a better objective video quality metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 5th Workshop on Image/Video/Audio Quality Assessment in Computer Vision, VLM and Diffusion Model (WVAQ), at IEEE/CVF WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[HONEYBEE: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via Dynamic Partitioning[Technical Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise deployments of vector databases require access control policies to protect sensitive data. These systems often implement access control through hybrid vector queries that combine nearest-neighbor search with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: dedicated per-user indexes minimize query latency but incur high memory redundancy, while shared indexes with post-search filtering reduce memory overhead at the cost of increased latency. This paper introduces HONEYBEE, a dynamic partitioning framework that leverages the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to create a smooth trade-off between these extremes. RBAC policies organize users into roles and assign permissions at the role level, creating a natural ``thin waist`` in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HONEYBEE produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling memory overhead. To guide these decisions, HONEYBEE develops analytical models of vector search performance and recall, and formulates partitioning as a constrained optimization problem that balances memory usage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HONEYBEE achieves up to 13.5X lower query latency than row-level security with only a 1.24X increase in memory usage, while achieving comparable query performance to dedicated, per-role indexes with 90.4% reduction in additional memory consumption, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation for EMG-Based Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04181v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Physics Discovery from Highly Corrupted Data: A PINN Framework Applied to the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04176v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Uncovering Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Pragmatic Gerontology Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14893v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting heterogeneity in treatment response enriches the interpretation of gerontologic trials. In aging research, estimating the effect of the intervention on clinically meaningful outcomes faces analytical challenges when it is truncated by death. For example, in the Whole Systems Demonstrator trial, a large cluster-randomized study evaluating telecare among older adults, the overall effect of the intervention on quality of life was found to be null. However, this marginal intervention estimate obscures potential heterogeneity of individuals responding to the intervention, particularly among those who survive to the end of follow-up. To explore this heterogeneity, we adopt a causal framework grounded in principal stratification, targeting the Survivor Average Causal Effect (SACE)-the treatment effect among "always-survivors," or those who would survive regardless of treatment assignment. We extend this framework using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a nonparametric machine learning method, to flexibly model both latent principal strata and stratum-specific potential outcomes. This enables the estimation of the Conditional SACE (CSACE), allowing us to uncover variation in treatment effects across subgroups defined by baseline characteristics. Our analysis reveals that despite the null average effect, some subgroups experience distinct quality of life benefits (or lack thereof) from telecare, highlighting opportunities for more personalized intervention strategies. This study demonstrates how embedding machine learning methods, such as BART, within a principled causal inference framework can offer deeper insights into trial data with complex features including truncation by death and clustering-key considerations in analyzing pragmatic gerontology trials.</p></details> |  |

| **[SpatialTree: How Spatial Abilities Branch Out in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20617v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://spatialtree.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[UniVideo: Unified Understanding, Generation, and Editing for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08377v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design preserves the MLLM's original text generation capabilities, enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions, and maintains visual consistency in the generated content. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as changing the environment or altering materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we released our model and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website https://congwei1230.github.io/UniVideo/</p></details> |
| **[When Helpers Become Hazards: A Benchmark for Analyzing Multimodal LLM-Powered Safety in Daily Life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04043v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/xinyuelou/SaLAD.</p></details> |  |

Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design. The code and model are available at https://github.com/wuhaer/PosterVerse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Vision Language Models Cross-Cultural Theory of Mind Reasoners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17394v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to attribute beliefs and intents to others - is fundamental for social intelligence, yet Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations remain largely Western-centric. In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a benchmark of 5,095 visually situated ToM probes across diverse cultural contexts, rituals, and social norms. Constructed through a frontier proprietary MLLM, human-verified pipeline, the dataset spans a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four complexity levels. We benchmark 10 VLMs (2023-2025) and observe a significant performance leap: while earlier models struggle, frontier models achieve high accuracy (>93%). However, significant limitations persist: models struggle with false belief reasoning (19-83% accuracy) and show high regional variance (20-30% gaps). Crucially, we find that SOTA models exhibit social desirability bias - systematically favoring semantically positive answer choices over negative ones. Ablation experiments reveal that some frontier models rely heavily on parametric social priors, frequently defaulting to safety-aligned predictions. Furthermore, while Chain-of-Thought prompting aids older models, it yields minimal gains for newer ones. Overall, our work provides a testbed for cross-cultural social reasoning, underscoring that despite architectural gains, achieving robust, visually grounded understanding remains an open challenge.</p></details> |  |

We propose Faithful-First Reasoning, Planning, and Acting (RPA) framework in which FaithEvi provides step-wise and chain-level supervision by evaluating the faithfulness of intermediate reasoning, and FaithAct uses these signals to plan and execute faithfulness-aware actions during inference. Experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that faithful-first RPA improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 24% over prompt-based and tool-augmented reasoning frameworks, without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle perceptually faithful reasoning trajectories and mitigates hallucination behavior. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, updated version</p></details> |

This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Accepted to EACL 2026 (Industrial Track)</p></details> |
| **[Where MLLMs Attend and What They Rely On: Explaining Autoregressive Token Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22496v4)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score), optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Artemis: A Deliberative Cognitive Framework for Mobile GUI Multi-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21799v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mem-Gallery: Benchmarking Multimodal Long-Term Conversational Memory for MLLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03515v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.</p></details> | 34 pages, 18 figures |

| **[Embedding Autonomous Agents in Resource-Constrained Robotic Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04191v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an open-access, author-archived version of a manuscript published in European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[Transforming Video Subjective Testing with Training, Engagement, and Real-Time Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04184v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subjective video quality assessment is crucial for optimizing streaming and compression, yet traditional protocols face limitations in capturing nuanced perceptual differences and ensuring reliable user input. We propose an integrated framework that enhances rater training, enforces attention through real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons to recover quality scores with fewer comparisons. Participants first undergo an automated training quiz to learn key video quality indicators (e.g., compression artifacts) and verify their readiness. During the test, a real-time attention scoring mechanism, using "golden" video pairs, monitors and reinforces rater focus by applying penalties for lapses. An efficient chain-based pairwise comparison procedure is then employed, yielding quality scores in Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD) units. Experiments comparing three groups (no training, training without feedback, and training with feedback) with 80 participants demonstrate that training-quiz significantly improves data quality in terms of golden unit accuracy and reduces tie rate, while real-time feedback further improves data quality and yields the most monotonic quality ratings. The new training, quiz, testing with feedback, 3-phase approach can significantly reduce the non-monotonic cases on the high quality part of the R-Q curve where normal viewer typically prefer the slightly compressed less-grainy content and help train a better objective video quality metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 5th Workshop on Image/Video/Audio Quality Assessment in Computer Vision, VLM and Diffusion Model (WVAQ), at IEEE/CVF WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[HONEYBEE: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via Dynamic Partitioning[Technical Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538v3)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise deployments of vector databases require access control policies to protect sensitive data. These systems often implement access control through hybrid vector queries that combine nearest-neighbor search with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: dedicated per-user indexes minimize query latency but incur high memory redundancy, while shared indexes with post-search filtering reduce memory overhead at the cost of increased latency. This paper introduces HONEYBEE, a dynamic partitioning framework that leverages the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to create a smooth trade-off between these extremes. RBAC policies organize users into roles and assign permissions at the role level, creating a natural ``thin waist`` in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HONEYBEE produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling memory overhead. To guide these decisions, HONEYBEE develops analytical models of vector search performance and recall, and formulates partitioning as a constrained optimization problem that balances memory usage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HONEYBEE achieves up to 13.5X lower query latency than row-level security with only a 1.24X increase in memory usage, while achieving comparable query performance to dedicated, per-role indexes with 90.4% reduction in additional memory consumption, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation for EMG-Based Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04181v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Physics Discovery from Highly Corrupted Data: A PINN Framework Applied to the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04176v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Uncovering Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Pragmatic Gerontology Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14893v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting heterogeneity in treatment response enriches the interpretation of gerontologic trials. In aging research, estimating the effect of the intervention on clinically meaningful outcomes faces analytical challenges when it is truncated by death. For example, in the Whole Systems Demonstrator trial, a large cluster-randomized study evaluating telecare among older adults, the overall effect of the intervention on quality of life was found to be null. However, this marginal intervention estimate obscures potential heterogeneity of individuals responding to the intervention, particularly among those who survive to the end of follow-up. To explore this heterogeneity, we adopt a causal framework grounded in principal stratification, targeting the Survivor Average Causal Effect (SACE)-the treatment effect among "always-survivors," or those who would survive regardless of treatment assignment. We extend this framework using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a nonparametric machine learning method, to flexibly model both latent principal strata and stratum-specific potential outcomes. This enables the estimation of the Conditional SACE (CSACE), allowing us to uncover variation in treatment effects across subgroups defined by baseline characteristics. Our analysis reveals that despite the null average effect, some subgroups experience distinct quality of life benefits (or lack thereof) from telecare, highlighting opportunities for more personalized intervention strategies. This study demonstrates how embedding machine learning methods, such as BART, within a principled causal inference framework can offer deeper insights into trial data with complex features including truncation by death and clustering-key considerations in analyzing pragmatic gerontology trials.</p></details> |  |
