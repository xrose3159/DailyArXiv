| **[The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[NeuralRemaster: Phase-Preserving Diffusion for Structure-Aligned Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05106v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation. Videos, additional examples, and code are available on our \href{https://yuzeng-at-tri.github.io/ppd-page/}{project page}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Soft Bootstrapping: Long Context Reasoning in LLMs without Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05105v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping, and the model, curated dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[TV2TV: A Unified Framework for Interleaved Language and Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05103v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioAnalyst: A Foundation Model for Biodiversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09080v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Foundation Models (FMs) offer a path to learn general-purpose representations from heterogeneous ecological data, easily transferable to downstream tasks. However, practical biodiversity modelling remains fragmented; separate pipelines and models are built for each dataset and objective, which limits reuse across regions and taxa. In response, we present BioAnalyst, to our knowledge the first multimodal Foundation Model tailored to biodiversity analysis and conservation planning in Europe at $0.25^{\circ}$ spatial resolution targeting regional to national-scale applications. BioAnalyst employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multimodal datasets that align species occurrence records with remote sensing indicators, climate and environmental variables. Post pre-training, the model is adapted via lightweight roll-out fine-tuning to a range of downstream tasks, including joint species distribution modelling, biodiversity dynamics and population trend forecasting. The model is evaluated on two representative downstream use cases: (i) joint species distribution modelling and with 500 vascular plant species (ii) monthly climate linear probing with temperature and precipitation data. Our findings show that BioAnalyst can provide a strong baseline both for biotic and abiotic tasks, acting as a macroecological simulator with a yearly forecasting horizon and monthly resolution, offering the first application of this type of modelling in the biodiversity domain. We have open-sourced the model weights, training and fine-tuning pipelines to advance AI-driven ecological research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Diffusion Models in General State Spaces: A Self-Contained Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05092v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models now occupy a central place in generative modeling, introductory treatments commonly assume Euclidean data and seldom clarify their connection to discrete-state analogues. This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.</p></details> |  |

| **[Splannequin: Freezing Monocular Mannequin-Challenge Footage with Dual-Detection Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05113v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/CaraJ7/DraCo</p></details> |

We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation. Code and dataset will be open-sourced to advance research and applications in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Reasoning Tracer: Object-Level Grounded Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05091v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance on tasks such as visual grounding and visual question answering. However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k achieve substantial improvements in tracing the reasoning path.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://harboryuan.github.io/visual-reasoning-tracer</p></details> |

Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 pr...</summary><p>v2 preprint.

Existing approaches typically enhance either perception, by augmenting RGB inputs with auxiliary modalities such as depth and segmentation, or reasoning, by training on spatial VQA datasets and applying reinforcement learning, and thus treat these two aspects in isolation. In this work, we investigate whether a unified MLLM can develop an intrinsic ability to enhance spatial perception and, through adaptive interleaved reasoning, achieve stronger spatial intelligence. We propose \textbf{COOPER}, a unified MLLM that leverages depth and segmentation as auxiliary modalities and is trained in two stages to acquire auxiliary modality generation and adaptive, interleaved reasoning capabilities. COOPER achieves an average \textbf{6.91\%} improvement in spatial reasoning while maintaining general performance. Moreover, even a variant trained only for auxiliary modality generation attains a \textbf{7.92\%} gain on distance and size estimation, suggesting that learning to generate auxiliary modalities helps internalize spatial knowledge and strengthen spatial understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViRectify: A Challenging Benchmark for Video Reasoning Correction with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01424v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose ViRectify, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30K instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In ViRectify, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our ViRectify serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on ViRectify, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe ViRectify provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |
| **[BiTAgent: A Task-Aware Modular Framework for Bidirectional Coupling between Multimodal Large Language Models and World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04513v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generalist embodied agents requires a unified system that can interpret multimodal goals, model environment dynamics, and execute reliable actions across diverse real-world tasks. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViDiC: Video Difference Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03405v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding visual differences between dynamic scenes requires the comparative perception of compositional, spatial, and temporal changes--a capability that remains underexplored in existing vision-language systems. While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities. We hope ViDiC-1K can be a challenging benchmark that lays a solid foundation for advancing video understanding, edit awareness, and comparative reasoning in multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamEQA: Towards Streaming Video Understanding for Embodied Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04451v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied intelligence advances toward real-world deployment, the ability to continuously perceive and reason over streaming visual inputs becomes essential. In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TempR1: Improving Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Temporal-Aware Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03963v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the temporal understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for advancing long-form video analysis, enabling tasks such as temporal localization, action detection, and time-sensitive question answering. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[DraCo: Draft as CoT for Text-to-Image Preview and Rare Concept Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05112v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/CaraJ7/DraCo</p></details> |
| **[ShadowDraw: From Any Object to Shadow-Drawing Compositional Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05110v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ShadowDraw, a framework that transforms ordinary 3D objects into shadow-drawing compositional art. Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling. Check out our project page https://red-fairy.github.io/ShadowDraw/ for more results and an end-to-end real-world demonstration of our pipeline!</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://red-fairy.github.io/ShadowDraw/</p></details> |
| **[NeuralRemaster: Phase-Preserving Diffusion for Structure-Aligned Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05106v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation. Videos, additional examples, and code are available on our \href{https://yuzeng-at-tri.github.io/ppd-page/}{project page}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Soft Bootstrapping: Long Context Reasoning in LLMs without Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05105v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping, and the model, curated dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[TV2TV: A Unified Framework for Interleaved Language and Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05103v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioAnalyst: A Foundation Model for Biodiversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09080v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Foundation Models (FMs) offer a path to learn general-purpose representations from heterogeneous ecological data, easily transferable to downstream tasks. However, practical biodiversity modelling remains fragmented; separate pipelines and models are built for each dataset and objective, which limits reuse across regions and taxa. In response, we present BioAnalyst, to our knowledge the first multimodal Foundation Model tailored to biodiversity analysis and conservation planning in Europe at $0.25^{\circ}$ spatial resolution targeting regional to national-scale applications. BioAnalyst employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multimodal datasets that align species occurrence records with remote sensing indicators, climate and environmental variables. Post pre-training, the model is adapted via lightweight roll-out fine-tuning to a range of downstream tasks, including joint species distribution modelling, biodiversity dynamics and population trend forecasting. The model is evaluated on two representative downstream use cases: (i) joint species distribution modelling and with 500 vascular plant species (ii) monthly climate linear probing with temperature and precipitation data. Our findings show that BioAnalyst can provide a strong baseline both for biotic and abiotic tasks, acting as a macroecological simulator with a yearly forecasting horizon and monthly resolution, offering the first application of this type of modelling in the biodiversity domain. We have open-sourced the model weights, training and fine-tuning pipelines to advance AI-driven ecological research.</p></details> |  |
