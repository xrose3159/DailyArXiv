| **[Rethinking Video Generation Model for the Embodied World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15282v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/ReVidgen/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/ReVidgen.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Prediction for Hospital Readmission in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16463v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hospital readmission among patients with chronic heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and economic burden. Dynamic prediction models that leverage longitudinal biomarkers may improve risk stratification over traditional static models. This study aims to develop and validate a joint model using longitudinal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements to predict the risk of rehospitalization or death in HF patients. We analyzed real-world data from the TriNetX database, including patients with an incident HF diagnosis between 2016 and 2022. The final selected cohort included 1,804 patients. A Bayesian joint modeling framework was developed to link patient-specific NT-proBNP trajectories to the risk of a composite endpoint (HF rehospitalization or all-cause mortality) within a 180-day window following hospital discharge. The model's performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and assessed with the Integrated Brier Score and Integrated Calibration Index. The joint model demonstrated a strong predictive advantage over a benchmark static model, particularly when making updated predictions at later time points (180-360 days). A joint model trained on patients with more frequent NT-proBNP measurements achieved the highest accuracy. The main joint model showed excellent calibration, suggesting its risk estimates are reliable. Our findings suggest that modeling the full trajectory of NT-proBNP with a joint modeling framework enables more accurate and dynamic risk assessment compared to static, single-timepoint methods. This approach supports the development of adaptive clinical decision-support tools for personalized HF management.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[RayRoPE: Projective Ray Positional Encoding for Multi-view Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15275v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://rayrope.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EVT-Based Rate-Preserving Distributional Robustness for Tail Risk Functionals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16230v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) focus on extreme losses, where scarce tail data makes model error unavoidable. To hedge misspecification, one evaluates worst-case tail risk over an ambiguity set. Using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), we derive first-order asymptotics for worst-case tail risk for a broad class of tail-risk measures under standard ambiguity sets, including Wasserstein balls and $φ$-divergence neighborhoods. We show that robustification can alter the nominal tail asymptotic scaling as the tail level $β\to0$, leading to excess risk inflation. Motivated by this diagnostic, we propose a tail-calibrated ambiguity design that preserves the nominal tail asymptotic scaling while still guarding against misspecification. Under standard domain of attraction assumptions, we prove that the resulting worst-case risk preserves the baseline first-order scaling as $β\to0$, uniformly over key tuning parameters, and that a plug-in implementation based on consistent tail-index estimation inherits these guarantees. Synthetic and real-data experiments show that the proposed design avoids the severe inflation often induced by standard ambiguity sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many Experiments, Few Repetitions, Unpaired Data, and Sparse Effects: Is Causal Inference Possible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15254v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of estimating causal effects under hidden confounding in the following unpaired data setting: we observe some covariates $X$ and an outcome $Y$ under different experimental conditions (environments) but do not observe them jointly; we either observe $X$ or $Y$. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the environment acting as a (possibly high-dimensional) instrument. When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent. We propose a GMM-type estimator based on cross-fold sample splitting of the instrument-covariate sample and prove that it is consistent as the number of environments grows but the sample size per environment remains constant. We further extend the method to sparse causal effects via $\ell_1$-regularized estimation and post-selection refitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommending Best Paper Awards for ML/AI Conferences via the Isotonic Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15249v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed Agent-Constrained Truthful Facility Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15258v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a distributed facility location problem in which a set of agents, each with a private position on the real line, is partitioned into a collection of fixed, disjoint groups. The goal is to open $k$ facilities at locations chosen from the set of positions reported by the agents. This decision is made by mechanisms that operate in two phases. In Phase 1, each group selects the position of one of its agents to serve as the group's representative location. In Phase 2, $k$ representatives are chosen as facility locations. Once the facility locations are determined, each agent incurs an individual cost, defined either as the sum of its distances to all facilities (sum-variant) or as the distance to its farthest facility (max-variant). We focus on the class of strategyproof mechanisms, which preclude the agents from benefiting through strategic misreporting, and establish tight bounds on the approximation ratio with respect to the social cost (the total individual agent cost) in both variants.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Understanding Best Practices for Quantization of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15287v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

Effective knowledge filtering is crucial for improving accuracy. Typical filtering methods use similarity metrics to locate relevant article sections from one article, leading to information selection errors at the article and intra-article levels. Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method. This approach can perform question-focused, cross-article filtering, efficiently obtaining high-quality filtered knowledge while keeping computational costs comparable to typical methods. Specifically, we design a trainable Question-Focused Filter (QFF) and a Chunk-based Dynamic Multi-Article Selection (CDA) module, which collectively alleviate information selection errors at both the article and intra-article levels. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models by 4.9% on E-VQA and 3.8% on InfoSeek, validating its effectiveness. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/leaffeall/QKVQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperphantasia: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Mental Visualization Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each puzzle is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free In-Context Forensic Chain for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10111v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version was uploaded in error and contains misleading information found in an early draft.

However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Main Track |

An Analysis of Unaligned and Aligned Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05553v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.</p></details> | EACL2026 |

We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.05879</p></details> |

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p></details> |  |

Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/ReVidgen/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/ReVidgen.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Prediction for Hospital Readmission in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16463v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hospital readmission among patients with chronic heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and economic burden. Dynamic prediction models that leverage longitudinal biomarkers may improve risk stratification over traditional static models. This study aims to develop and validate a joint model using longitudinal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements to predict the risk of rehospitalization or death in HF patients. We analyzed real-world data from the TriNetX database, including patients with an incident HF diagnosis between 2016 and 2022. The final selected cohort included 1,804 patients. A Bayesian joint modeling framework was developed to link patient-specific NT-proBNP trajectories to the risk of a composite endpoint (HF rehospitalization or all-cause mortality) within a 180-day window following hospital discharge. The model's performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and assessed with the Integrated Brier Score and Integrated Calibration Index. The joint model demonstrated a strong predictive advantage over a benchmark static model, particularly when making updated predictions at later time points (180-360 days). A joint model trained on patients with more frequent NT-proBNP measurements achieved the highest accuracy. The main joint model showed excellent calibration, suggesting its risk estimates are reliable. Our findings suggest that modeling the full trajectory of NT-proBNP with a joint modeling framework enables more accurate and dynamic risk assessment compared to static, single-timepoint methods. This approach supports the development of adaptive clinical decision-support tools for personalized HF management.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[EVT-Based Rate-Preserving Distributional Robustness for Tail Risk Functionals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16230v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) focus on extreme losses, where scarce tail data makes model error unavoidable. To hedge misspecification, one evaluates worst-case tail risk over an ambiguity set. Using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), we derive first-order asymptotics for worst-case tail risk for a broad class of tail-risk measures under standard ambiguity sets, including Wasserstein balls and $φ$-divergence neighborhoods. We show that robustification can alter the nominal tail asymptotic scaling as the tail level $β\to0$, leading to excess risk inflation. Motivated by this diagnostic, we propose a tail-calibrated ambiguity design that preserves the nominal tail asymptotic scaling while still guarding against misspecification. Under standard domain of attraction assumptions, we prove that the resulting worst-case risk preserves the baseline first-order scaling as $β\to0$, uniformly over key tuning parameters, and that a plug-in implementation based on consistent tail-index estimation inherits these guarantees. Synthetic and real-data experiments show that the proposed design avoids the severe inflation often induced by standard ambiguity sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many Experiments, Few Repetitions, Unpaired Data, and Sparse Effects: Is Causal Inference Possible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15254v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of estimating causal effects under hidden confounding in the following unpaired data setting: we observe some covariates $X$ and an outcome $Y$ under different experimental conditions (environments) but do not observe them jointly; we either observe $X$ or $Y$. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the environment acting as a (possibly high-dimensional) instrument. When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent. We propose a GMM-type estimator based on cross-fold sample splitting of the instrument-covariate sample and prove that it is consistent as the number of environments grows but the sample size per environment remains constant. We further extend the method to sparse causal effects via $\ell_1$-regularized estimation and post-selection refitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommending Best Paper Awards for ML/AI Conferences via the Isotonic Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15249v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.</p></details> |  |
