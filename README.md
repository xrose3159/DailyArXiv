| **[UniX: Unifying Autoregression and Diffusion for Chest X-Ray Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11522v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

| **[How Long Is a Piece of String? A Brief Empirical Analysis of Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11518v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach targets low probability high consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a manuscript currently under review at Electric Power Systems Research.

| **[ShapeR: Robust Conditional 3D Shape Generation from Casual Captures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11514v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://facebookresearch.github.io/ShapeR Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbY30KAA55I</p></details> |
| **[Capacity Constraints Make Admissions Processes Less Predictable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11513v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are often used to make predictions about admissions process outcomes, such as for colleges or jobs. However, such decision processes differ substantially from the conventional machine learning paradigm. Because admissions decisions are capacity-constrained, whether a student is admitted depends on the other applicants who apply. We show how this dependence affects predictive performance even in otherwise ideal settings. Theoretically, we introduce two concepts that characterize the relationship between admission function properties, machine learning representation, and generalization to applicant pool distribution shifts: instability, which measures how many existing decisions can change when a single new applicant is introduced; and variability, which measures the number of unique students whose decisions can change. Empirically, we illustrate our theory on individual-level admissions data from the New York City high school matching system, showing that machine learning performance degrades as the applicant pool increasingly differs from the training data. Furthermore, there are larger performance drops for schools using decision rules that are more unstable and variable. Our work raises questions about the reliability of predicting individual admissions probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the 2026 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence AI for Social Impact Track</p></details> |
| **[Industry Influence in High-Profile Social Media Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11507v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To what extent is social media research independent from industry influence? Leveraging openly available data, we show that half of the research published in top journals has disclosable ties to industry in the form of prior funding, collaboration, or employment. However, the majority of these ties go undisclosed in the published research. These trends do not arise from broad scientific engagement with industry, but rather from a select group of scientists who maintain long-lasting relationships with industry. Undisclosed ties to industry are common not just among authors, but among reviewers and academic editors during manuscript evaluation. Further, industry-tied research garners more attention within the academy, among policymakers, on social media, and in the news. Finally, we find evidence that industry ties are associated with a topical focus away from impacts of platform-scale features. Together, these findings suggest industry influence in social media research is extensive, impactful, and often opaque. Going forward there is a need to strengthen disclosure norms and implement policies to ensure the visibility of independent research, and the integrity of industry supported research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[MetaboNet: The Largest Publicly Available Consolidated Dataset for Type 1 Diabetes Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11505v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 7 supplementary figures, submitted to JDST</p></details> |
| **[Coding Schemes for the Noisy Torn Paper Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11501v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Aggregation to Selection: User-Validated Distributed Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21388v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommender systems facilitate social connections by identifying potential friends for users. Each user maintains a local social network centered around themselves, resulting in a naturally distributed social structure. Recent research on distributed modeling for social recommender systems has gained increasing attention, as it naturally aligns with the user-centric structure of user interactions. Current distributed social recommender systems rely on automatically combining predictions from multiple models, often overlooking the user's active role in validating whether suggested connections are appropriate. Moreover, recommendation decisions are validated by individual users rather than derived from a single global ordering of candidates. As a result, standard ranking-based evaluation metrics make it difficult to evaluate whether a user-confirmed recommendation decision is actually correct. To address these limitations, we propose DeSocial, a distributed social recommendation framework with user-validation. DeSocial enables users to select recommendation algorithms to validate their potential connections, and the verification is processed through majority consensus among multiple independent user validators. To evaluate the distributed recommender system with user validator, we formulate this setting as a link prediction and verification task and introduce Acc@K, a consensus-based evaluation metric that measures whether user-approved recommendations are correct. Experiments on 4 real-world social networks shows that DeSocial improves decision correctness and robustness compared to single-point and distributed baselines. These findings highlight the potential of user-validated distributed recommender systems as a practical approach to social recommendation, with broader applicability to distributed and decentralized recommendations.

| **[Computational emotion analysis with multimodal LLMs: Current evidence on an emerging methodological opportunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10882v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze emotions in political communication. Multimodal large language models (mLLMs) promise to enable such analyses through in-context learning. However, we lack systematic evidence on whether these models can reliably measure emotions in real-world political settings. This paper evaluates leading mLLMs for video-based emotional arousal measurement using two complementary human-labeled video datasets: recordings created under laboratory conditions and real-world parliamentary debates. I find a critical lab-vs-field performance gap. In video created under laboratory conditions, mLLMs arousal scores approach human-level reliability with little to no demographic bias. However, in parliamentary debate recordings, all examined models' arousal scores correlate at best moderately with average human ratings and exhibit systematic bias by speaker gender and age. Neither relying on leading closed-source mLLMs nor computational noise mitigation strategies change this finding. Further, mLLMs underperform even in sentiment analysis when using video recordings instead of text transcripts of the same speeches. These findings reveal important limitations of current mLLMs for real-world political video analysis and establish a rigorous evaluation framework for tracking future developments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-AI Alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models with Speech-Language Pathologists in Parent-Child Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05879v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an earlier version of the work released in May 2025.

However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[A Safety Report on GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10527v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven major gains in reasoning, perception, and generation across language and vision, yet whether these advances translate into comparable improvements in safety remains unclear, partly due to fragmented evaluations that focus on isolated modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of six frontier models--GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5--assessing each across language, vision-language, and image generation using a unified protocol that combines benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations. By aggregating results into safety leaderboards and model profiles, we reveal a highly uneven safety landscape: while GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced performance, other models exhibit clear trade-offs across benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Despite strong results under standard benchmarks, all models remain highly vulnerable under adversarial testing, with worst-case safety rates dropping below 6%. Text-to-image models show slightly stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain fragile when faced with adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these findings highlight that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation design--underscoring the need for standardized, holistic safety assessments to better reflect real-world risk and guide responsible deployment.</p></details> | 41 pages, 22 figures |

In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm.

To address this gap, we introduce a 3.5k-sample affect-annotated InfoAffect dataset, which combines textual content with real-world infographics. We first collected the raw data from six fields and aligned it via preprocessing, the accompanied-text-priority method, and three strategies to guarantee quality and compliance. After that, we constructed an Affect Table to constrain annotation. We used five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze both modalities, and their outputs were fused with the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess the InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.608, which indicates high accuracy.

| **[Integrity Shield A System for Ethical AI Use & Authorship Transparency in Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11093v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.05879</p></details> |

Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce MADIAVE, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds, agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EACL 2026 (Findings)</p></details> |

However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.</p></details> |  |

| **[UniX: Unifying Autoregression and Diffusion for Chest X-Ray Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11522v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

| **[How Long Is a Piece of String? A Brief Empirical Analysis of Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11518v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Modeling of Power Outages during Extreme Events: Integrating Weather and Socio-Economic Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22699v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel learning based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach targets low probability high consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a manuscript currently under review at Electric Power Systems Research.

| **[ShapeR: Robust Conditional 3D Shape Generation from Casual Captures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11514v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://facebookresearch.github.io/ShapeR Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbY30KAA55I</p></details> |
| **[Capacity Constraints Make Admissions Processes Less Predictable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11513v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are often used to make predictions about admissions process outcomes, such as for colleges or jobs. However, such decision processes differ substantially from the conventional machine learning paradigm. Because admissions decisions are capacity-constrained, whether a student is admitted depends on the other applicants who apply. We show how this dependence affects predictive performance even in otherwise ideal settings. Theoretically, we introduce two concepts that characterize the relationship between admission function properties, machine learning representation, and generalization to applicant pool distribution shifts: instability, which measures how many existing decisions can change when a single new applicant is introduced; and variability, which measures the number of unique students whose decisions can change. Empirically, we illustrate our theory on individual-level admissions data from the New York City high school matching system, showing that machine learning performance degrades as the applicant pool increasingly differs from the training data. Furthermore, there are larger performance drops for schools using decision rules that are more unstable and variable. Our work raises questions about the reliability of predicting individual admissions probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the 2026 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence AI for Social Impact Track</p></details> |
| **[Industry Influence in High-Profile Social Media Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11507v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To what extent is social media research independent from industry influence? Leveraging openly available data, we show that half of the research published in top journals has disclosable ties to industry in the form of prior funding, collaboration, or employment. However, the majority of these ties go undisclosed in the published research. These trends do not arise from broad scientific engagement with industry, but rather from a select group of scientists who maintain long-lasting relationships with industry. Undisclosed ties to industry are common not just among authors, but among reviewers and academic editors during manuscript evaluation. Further, industry-tied research garners more attention within the academy, among policymakers, on social media, and in the news. Finally, we find evidence that industry ties are associated with a topical focus away from impacts of platform-scale features. Together, these findings suggest industry influence in social media research is extensive, impactful, and often opaque. Going forward there is a need to strengthen disclosure norms and implement policies to ensure the visibility of independent research, and the integrity of industry supported research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[MetaboNet: The Largest Publicly Available Consolidated Dataset for Type 1 Diabetes Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11505v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 7 supplementary figures, submitted to JDST</p></details> |
| **[Coding Schemes for the Noisy Torn Paper Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11501v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.</p></details> |  |
