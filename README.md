To address this gap, we introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2. Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over 11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the next generation of code-based research benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We present an empirical study on applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards. Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ready to Translate, Not to Represent? Bias and Performance Gaps in Multilingual LLMs Across Language Families and Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07877v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation (MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub: https://github.com/faiyazabdullah/TranslationTangles</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Help You at Work?

Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth. However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings, featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in enterprise-focused AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178v5)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench -- the first comprehensive benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments, covering both explicit and implicit hazards. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 9 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. Dataset and codes are available in https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/safeagentbench/SafeAgentBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 19 tables, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fints: Efficient Inference-Time Personalization for LLMs with Fine-Grained Instance-Tailored Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27206v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods, including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency, excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths. Implementation is available at https://github.com/KounianhuaDu/Fints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring the Security of Mobile LLM Agents under Adversarial Prompts from Untrusted Third-Party Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27140v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[PartnerMAS: An LLM Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Business Partner Selection on High-Dimensional Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24046v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection, involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical, categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unstructured Data Analysis using LLMs: A Comprehensive Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27119v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, the explosion of unstructured data presents immense analytical value. Leveraging the remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in extracting attributes of structured tables from unstructured data, researchers are developing LLM-powered data systems for users to analyze unstructured documents as working with a database. These unstructured data analysis (UDA) systems differ significantly in all aspects, including query interfaces, query optimization strategies, and operator implementations, making it unclear which performs best in which scenario. Unfortunately, there does not exist a comprehensive benchmark that offers high-quality, large-volume, and diverse datasets as well as rich query workload to thoroughly evaluate such systems. To fill this gap, we present UDA-Bench, the first benchmark for unstructured data analysis that meets all the above requirements. Specifically, we organize a team with 30 graduate students that spends over in total 10,000 hours on curating 5 datasets from various domains and constructing a relational database view from these datasets by manual annotation. These relational databases can be used as ground truth to evaluate any of these UDA systems despite their differences in programming interfaces. Moreover, we design diverse queries to analyze the attributes defined in the database schema, covering different types of analytical operators with varying selectivities and complexities. We conduct in-depth analysis of the key building blocks of existing UDA systems: query interface, query optimization, operator design, and data processing. We run exhaustive experiments over the benchmark to fully evaluate these systems and different techniques w.r.t. the above building blocks.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage. This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG, leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BioCAS2025</p></details> |

| **[PETAR: Localized Findings Generation with Mask-Aware Vision-Language Modeling for PET Automated Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27680v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |

This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. Motivated by growing demands to surface tacit knowledge, we present the Data Therapist, a web-based system that helps domain experts externalize such implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system automatically analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and supports annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. A qualitative study with expert pairs from Accounting, Political Science, and Computer Security revealed recurring patterns in how expert reason about their data and highlighted opportunities for AI support to enhance visualization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORGEval: Graph-Theoretic Evaluation of LLMs in Optimization Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27610v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism. Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even leading reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

I-RAVEN-X extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th Workshop on Mathematical Reasoning and AI (MATH-AI), NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

| **[Multilingual BERT language model for medical tasks: Evaluation on domain-specific adaptation and cross-linguality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27552v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap, the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability. Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP. Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRoPE: Rotary Position Embedding for Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11664v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has shown strong performance in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), but extending it to video remains a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal structure of video frames. Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks.

While recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication. DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of 15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs (1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization. DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive evaluation and future model development.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 tables |
| **[A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12989v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</p></details> | Accepted to ICWSM'26 |

In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection accuracy with a low computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Therapist: Eliciting Domain Knowledge from Subject Matter Experts Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00455v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. Motivated by growing demands to surface tacit knowledge, we present the Data Therapist, a web-based system that helps domain experts externalize such implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system automatically analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and supports annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. A qualitative study with expert pairs from Accounting, Political Science, and Computer Security revealed recurring patterns in how expert reason about their data and highlighted opportunities for AI support to enhance visualization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Practices for Biorisk Evaluations on Open-Weight Bio-Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27629v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \eval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \eval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 5 figures |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models: Novel Analysis and New Sampler Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16756v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers. Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to their theoretical and empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of $\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of other stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Absorb and Converge: Provable Convergence Guarantee for Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02318v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.</p></details> |  |
| **[C3Editor: Achieving Controllable Consistency in 2D Model for 3D Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04539v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views. To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent 2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Workshop Wild3D</p></details> |
| **[HELIOS: Adaptive Model And Early-Exit Selection for Efficient LLM Inference Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10724v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-Exit Large Language Models (EE-LLMs) enable high throughput inference by allowing tokens to exit early at intermediate layers. However, their throughput is limited by the computational and memory savings. Existing EE-LLM frameworks rely on a single model and therefore, their token generation latencies are bottlenecked by tokens that do not exit early and traverse additional layers. Moreover, early exits are only known at runtime and depend on the request. Therefore, these frameworks load the weights of all model layers even though large portions remain unused when tokens exit early. The lack of memory savings limit us from scaling the batch sizes. We propose $\textit{HELIOS}$, a framework that improves both token generation latency and batch sizes to enable high-throughput in EE-LLMs. HELIOS exploits two insights. $\textit{First}$, early exits are often complimentary across models, tokens that do not exit early on one model often take an early-exit on another. HELIOS employs multiple models and dynamically switches between them to collectively maximize the number of tokens that exit early, and minimize token generation latencies. $\textit{Second}$, even when a predicted token does not exit early due to poor confidence, it often remains unchanged even after additional layer traversal. HELIOS greedily allows such tokens to exit early and only loads the weights of the most likely to be used layers, yielding memory savings which is then re-purposed to increase batch sizes. HELIOS employs real-time profiling to accurately identify the early-exit distributions, and adaptively switches between models by tracking tokens in real-time to minimize the performance degradation caused by greedy model loading and exiting. Our evaluations show that HELIOS achieves $1.48\times$ higher throughput and $15.14\times$ larger batch size compared to existing EE-LLM frameworks.</p></details> |  |
