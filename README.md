Inspired by advances in language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal training and performance addressing key questions related to data representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We show how to tokenize complex 3D objects to incorporate into our structured 3D scene modality. We evaluate performance across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We show our model's effectiveness on reconstructing complete 3D scenes consisting of complex objects from a single image and on real-world 3D object recognition tasks.

| **[Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) for Emergent Communication Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03254v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of emergent communication within multi-agent systems examines how autonomous agents can independently develop communication strategies, without explicit programming, and adapt them to varied environments. However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiniDepth: Arbitrary-Resolution and Fine-Grained Depth Estimation with Neural Implicit Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03252v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Versatile Multimodal Agent for Multimedia Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03250v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.</p></details> |  |
| **[STReasoner: Empowering LLMs for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Time Series via Spatial-Aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03248v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |
| **[ShareChat: A Dataset of Chatbot Conversations in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17843v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While academic research typically treats Large Language Models (LLM) as generic text generators, they are distinct commercial products with unique interfaces and capabilities that fundamentally shape user behavior. Current datasets obscure this reality by collecting text-only data through uniform interfaces that fail to capture authentic chatbot usage. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale corpus of 142,808 conversations (660,293 turns) sourced directly from publicly shared URLs on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, and Claude. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances, such as citations and thinking traces, across a diverse collection covering 101 languages and the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. To illustrate the dataset's breadth, we present three case studies: a completeness analysis of intent satisfaction, a citation study of model grounding, and a temporal analysis of engagement rhythms. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild. The dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Spectral Modeling and Control of Soft-Robotic Muscles from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03247v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial muscles are essential for compliant musculoskeletal robotics but complicate control due to nonlinear multiphysics dynamics. Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning from Noisy and Incomplete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03244v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems in science and engineering involve inferring a signal from noisy and/or incomplete observations, where the observation process is known. Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from examples of ground-truth signals and associated observations. However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLIM: Stealthy Low-Coverage Black-Box Watermarking via Latent-Space Confusion Zones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03242v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data is a critical and often proprietary asset in Large Language Model (LLM) development, motivating the use of data watermarking to embed model-transferable signals for usage verification. We identify low coverage as a vital yet largely overlooked requirement for practicality, as individual data owners typically contribute only a minute fraction of massive training corpora. Prior methods fail to maintain stealthiness, verification feasibility, or robustness when only one or a few sequences can be modified. To address these limitations, we introduce SLIM, a framework enabling per-user data provenance verification under strict black-box access. SLIM leverages intrinsic LLM properties to induce a Latent-Space Confusion Zone by training the model to map semantically similar prefixes to divergent continuations. This manifests as localized generation instability, which can be reliably detected via hypothesis testing. Experiments demonstrate that SLIM achieves ultra-low coverage capability, strong black-box verification performance, and great scalability while preserving both stealthiness and model utility, offering a robust solution for protecting training data in modern LLM pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Capacity Region of Individual Key Rates in Vector Linear Secure Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03241v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide new insights into an open problem recently posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025], concerning the minimum individual key rate required in the vector linear secure aggregation problem. Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\mathbf{F}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\mathbf{G}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\ldots,R_K) = (\mathbf{1}(1 \in \mathcal{I}),\ldots,\mathbf{1}(K\in \mathcal{I}))$, where $\mathcal{I}\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \textit{rank-increment condition}: $\mathrm{rank}\left(\bigl[\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}};\mathbf{G}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr]\right) =\mathrm{rank}\bigl(\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr)+N$. Here, $\mathbf{F}_\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathcal{I}$ are the submatrices formed by the columns indexed by $\mathcal{I}$. Our results uncover the novel fact that it is not necessary for every user to hold a key, thereby strictly enlarging the best-known achievable region in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a converse analysis to demonstrate its optimality when minimizing the number of users that hold keys.</p></details> |  |

| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval aims to make retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) more efficient and reliable by skipping retrieval when an LLM's parametric knowledge suffices. Despite promising results, existing methods are constrained by a binary design choice: either retrieve from a single external source or skip retrieval and let the LLM directly produce the final answer. We argue that this fallback underestimates the model's knowledge and obscures the more general multi-source decision problem that arises in practical systems. We propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), which casts selective retrieval as knowledge source selection and treats the LLM itself as a first-class knowledge source. SR-RAG learns to select an appropriate knowledge source, optionally verbalize parametric knowledge, and answer using the selected source, all within a single left-to-right generation pass. SR-RAG further augments source selection by combining LLM-based uncertainty with a flexible external policy datastore to improve decision calibration. Across four benchmarks and three 7B-class LLMs, SR-RAG outperforms a strong selective retrieval baseline by 8.5%/2.1%/4.7% while performing 26%/40%/21% fewer retrievals, and it achieves favorable accuracy-latency trade-offs without dataset-specific threshold tuning.</p></details> |  |

| **[Empowering Reliable Visual-Centric Instruction Following in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03198v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.</p></details> | Submitted to ARR Jan |
| **[Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[IBISAgent: Reinforcing Pixel-Level Visual Reasoning in MLLMs for Universal Biomedical Object Referring and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03054v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks.

| **[BusterX++: Towards Unified Cross-Modal AI-Generated Content Detection and Explanation with MLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14632v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a framework for unified detection and explanation of synthetic image and video, with a direct reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a unified benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protecting multimodal large language models against misleading visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20503v5)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visualizations play a pivotal role in daily communication in an increasingly data-driven world. Research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for automated chart understanding has accelerated massively, with steady improvements on standard benchmarks. However, for MLLMs to be reliable, they must be robust to misleading visualizations, i.e., charts that distort the underlying data, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Here, we uncover an important vulnerability: MLLM question-answering (QA) accuracy on misleading visualizations drops on average to the level of the random baseline. To address this, we provide the first comparison of six inference-time methods to improve QA performance on misleading visualizations, without compromising accuracy on non-misleading ones. We find that two methods, table-based QA and redrawing the visualization, are effective, with improvements of up to 19.6 percentage points. We make our code and data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[CVBench: Benchmarking Cross-Video Synergies for Complex Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19542v4)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their capability for spatiotemporal pattern reasoning across multiple videos remains a critical gap in pattern recognition research. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first diagnostic benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to analyze and integrate spatiotemporal patterns from dynamic visual streams. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 63.5% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91.3% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLMs architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for advancing pattern recognition methodologies in multi-video scenarios, providing architectural insights for next-generation models. The data and evaluation code are available at: https://github.com/Hokhim2/CVBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Faithful Reasoning in Comics for Small MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02991v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Artemis: A Deliberative Cognitive Framework for Mobile GUI Multi-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21799v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrismVAU: Prompt-Refined Inference System for Multimodal Video Anomaly Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02927v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 6th Workshop on Real-World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges (WACV 2025)</p></details> |

Inspired by advances in language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal training and performance addressing key questions related to data representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We show how to tokenize complex 3D objects to incorporate into our structured 3D scene modality. We evaluate performance across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We show our model's effectiveness on reconstructing complete 3D scenes consisting of complex objects from a single image and on real-world 3D object recognition tasks.

However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiniDepth: Arbitrary-Resolution and Fine-Grained Depth Estimation with Neural Implicit Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03252v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Versatile Multimodal Agent for Multimedia Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03250v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |
| **[ShareChat: A Dataset of Chatbot Conversations in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17843v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While academic research typically treats Large Language Models (LLM) as generic text generators, they are distinct commercial products with unique interfaces and capabilities that fundamentally shape user behavior. Current datasets obscure this reality by collecting text-only data through uniform interfaces that fail to capture authentic chatbot usage. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale corpus of 142,808 conversations (660,293 turns) sourced directly from publicly shared URLs on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, and Claude. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances, such as citations and thinking traces, across a diverse collection covering 101 languages and the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. To illustrate the dataset's breadth, we present three case studies: a completeness analysis of intent satisfaction, a citation study of model grounding, and a temporal analysis of engagement rhythms. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild. The dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Spectral Modeling and Control of Soft-Robotic Muscles from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03247v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial muscles are essential for compliant musculoskeletal robotics but complicate control due to nonlinear multiphysics dynamics. Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning from Noisy and Incomplete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03244v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems in science and engineering involve inferring a signal from noisy and/or incomplete observations, where the observation process is known. Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from examples of ground-truth signals and associated observations. However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLIM: Stealthy Low-Coverage Black-Box Watermarking via Latent-Space Confusion Zones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03242v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data is a critical and often proprietary asset in Large Language Model (LLM) development, motivating the use of data watermarking to embed model-transferable signals for usage verification. We identify low coverage as a vital yet largely overlooked requirement for practicality, as individual data owners typically contribute only a minute fraction of massive training corpora. Prior methods fail to maintain stealthiness, verification feasibility, or robustness when only one or a few sequences can be modified. To address these limitations, we introduce SLIM, a framework enabling per-user data provenance verification under strict black-box access. SLIM leverages intrinsic LLM properties to induce a Latent-Space Confusion Zone by training the model to map semantically similar prefixes to divergent continuations. This manifests as localized generation instability, which can be reliably detected via hypothesis testing. Experiments demonstrate that SLIM achieves ultra-low coverage capability, strong black-box verification performance, and great scalability while preserving both stealthiness and model utility, offering a robust solution for protecting training data in modern LLM pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Capacity Region of Individual Key Rates in Vector Linear Secure Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03241v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide new insights into an open problem recently posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025], concerning the minimum individual key rate required in the vector linear secure aggregation problem. Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\mathbf{F}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\mathbf{G}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\ldots,R_K) = (\mathbf{1}(1 \in \mathcal{I}),\ldots,\mathbf{1}(K\in \mathcal{I}))$, where $\mathcal{I}\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \textit{rank-increment condition}: $\mathrm{rank}\left(\bigl[\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}};\mathbf{G}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr]\right) =\mathrm{rank}\bigl(\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr)+N$. Here, $\mathbf{F}_\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathcal{I}$ are the submatrices formed by the columns indexed by $\mathcal{I}$. Our results uncover the novel fact that it is not necessary for every user to hold a key, thereby strictly enlarging the best-known achievable region in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a converse analysis to demonstrate its optimality when minimizing the number of users that hold keys.</p></details> |  |
