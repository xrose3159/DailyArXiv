| **[ShortCoder: Knowledge-Augmented Syntax Optimization for Token-Efficient Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09703v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Camera-Controlled Video Generation of Static Scenes via Sparse Diffusion and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09697v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ayushtewari.com/projects/srender/</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Geometric Learning Unlocks Unified Structure- and Ligand-Based Drug Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09693v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>ELLIS...</summary><p>ELLIS ML4Molecules Workshop 2025, ELLIS Unconference, Copenhagen 2025</p></details> |
| **[Routing with Generated Data: Annotation-Free LLM Skill Estimation and Expert Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09692v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/tianyiniu/RoutingGenData</p></details> |
| **[DeepResearchEval: An Automated Framework for Deep Research Task Construction and Agentic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09688v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems are widely used for multi-step web research, analysis, and cross-source synthesis, yet their evaluation remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/Infinity-AILab/DeepResearchEval</p></details> |
| **[LARGE: A Locally Adaptive Regularization Approach for Estimating Gaussian Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09686v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data. In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[SAM3-DMS: Decoupled Memory Selection for Multi-target Video Segmentation of SAM3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09699v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/FudanCVL/SAM3-DMS</p></details> |
| **[LLMs can Compress LLMs: Adaptive Pruning by Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09694v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.</p></details> | 17 Pages |

Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://peterjohnsonhuang.github.io/openvoxel-pages/</p></details> |

A Multimodal Study of Sound Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10045v5)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 27 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Omni-R1: Towards the Unified Generative Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09536v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-MSR: Benchmarking Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09430v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLAM-LLM: A Modular, Open-Source Multimodal Large Language Model Framework and Best Practice for Speech, Language, Audio and Music Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09385v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) frameworks, such as LLaVA, provides a convenient kickoff for artificial intelligence developers and researchers. However, most of the MLLM frameworks take vision as the main input modality, and provide limited in-depth support for the modality of speech, audio, and music. This situation hinders the development of audio-language models, and forces researchers to spend a lot of effort on code writing and hyperparameter tuning. We present SLAM-LLM, an open-source deep learning framework designed to train customized MLLMs, focused on speech, language, audio, and music processing. SLAM-LLM provides a modular configuration of different encoders, projectors, LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning plugins. SLAM-LLM also includes detailed training and inference recipes for mainstream tasks, along with high-performance checkpoints like LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automated Audio Captioning (AAC), and Music Captioning (MC). Some of these recipes have already reached or are nearing state-of-the-art performance, and some relevant techniques have also been accepted by academic papers. We hope SLAM-LLM will accelerate iteration, development, data engineering, and model training for researchers. We are committed to continually pushing forward audio-based MLLMs through this open-source framework, and call on the community to contribute to the LLM-based speech, audio and music processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal LLM based Image Captioning in ICT: Bridging the Gap Between General and Industry Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09298v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCGA: A Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09270v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their potential has garnered significant attention in Chinese Classical Studies (CCS). While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

| **[M3CoTBench: Benchmark Chain-of-Thought of MLLMs in Medical Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08758v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning, and recent advances have extended this paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

| **[The AI Hippocampus: How Far are We From Human Memory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09113v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.</p></details> |  |

| **[ShortCoder: Knowledge-Augmented Syntax Optimization for Token-Efficient Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09703v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Geometric Learning Unlocks Unified Structure- and Ligand-Based Drug Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09693v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>ELLIS...</summary><p>ELLIS ML4Molecules Workshop 2025, ELLIS Unconference, Copenhagen 2025</p></details> |
| **[Routing with Generated Data: Annotation-Free LLM Skill Estimation and Expert Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09692v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/tianyiniu/RoutingGenData</p></details> |
| **[LARGE: A Locally Adaptive Regularization Approach for Estimating Gaussian Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09686v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data. In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[OptiMind: Teaching LLMs to Think Like Optimization Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22979v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however, achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our OptiMind framework leverages semi-automated, class-based error analysis to guide both training and inference, explicitly preventing common mistakes within each optimization class. Our resulting fine-tuned LLM significantly improves formulation accuracy by 20.7% across multiple optimization benchmarks, with consistent gains under test-time scaling methods such as self-consistency and multi-turn feedback, enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Semi-Blind Deconvolution at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09677v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind image deconvolution refers to the problem of simultaneously estimating the blur kernel and the true image from a set of observations when both the blur kernel and the true image are unknown. Sometimes, additional image and/or blur information is available and the term semi-blind deconvolution (SBD) is used. We consider a recently introduced Bayesian conjugate hierarchical model for SBD, formulated on an extended cyclic lattice to allow a computationally scalable Gibbs sampler. In this article, we extend this model to the general SBD problem, rewrite the previously proposed Gibbs sampler so that operations are performed in the Fourier domain whenever possible, and introduce a new marginal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) blur update, obtained by analytically integrating the blur-image joint conditional over the image. The cyclic formulation combined with non-trivial linear algebra manipulations allows a Fourier-based, scalable HMC update, otherwise complicated by the rigid constraints of the SBD problem. Having determined the padding size in the cyclic embedding through a numerical experiment, we compare the mixing and exploration behaviour of the Gibbs and HMC blur updates on simulated data and on a real geophysical seismic imaging problem where we invert a grid with $300\times50$ nodes, corresponding to a posterior with approximately $80,000$ parameters.</p></details> |  |
