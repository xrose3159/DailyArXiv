| **[TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14698v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://timelens-arc-lab.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://crisp-real2sim.github.io/CRISP-Real2Sim/</p></details> |

Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: First Workshop on LLM Persona Modeling (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Native and Compact Structured Latents for 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14692v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D generative modeling have significantly improved the generation realism, yet the field is still hampered by existing representations, which struggle to capture assets with complex topologies and detailed appearance. This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://microsoft.github.io/TRELLIS.2/</p></details> |
| **[MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p></details> | work in progress |

Yet it remains challenging for a humanoid robot to perform forceful manipulation tasks such as moving objects, wiping, and pushing a cart. We propose adaptive Compliance Humanoid control through hIsight Perturbation (CHIP), a plug-and-play module that enables controllable end-effector stiffness while preserving agile tracking of dynamic reference motions. CHIP is easy to implement and requires neither data augmentation nor additional reward tuning.

However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Latex...</summary><p>Latex edits, fixed typos</p></details> |

| **[ViRC: Enhancing Visual Interleaved Mathematical CoT with Reason Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14654v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique challenges of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D, together with the instruction-tuning dataset EgoIT, which is collected from multiple sources to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Building upon the datasets, we propose a migration strategy and further design a progressive mapping learning pipeline with three stages: Demonstrator Self-Preparation, Demonstrator-Learner Guidance, and Learner Self-Practice. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Why Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Enables MLLMs Preserve Prior Knowledge Better: A Data Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23508v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.</p></details> | 28 pages (Preprint.) |
| **[Assessing Greenspace Attractiveness with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini: Do AI Models Reflect Human Perceptions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11827v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding greenspace attractiveness is essential for designing livable and inclusive urban environments, yet existing assessment approaches often overlook informal or transient spaces and remain too resource intensive to capture subjective perceptions at scale. This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartAgent: A Chart Understanding Framework with Tool Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14040v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their high information density and intuitive readability, charts have become the de facto medium for data analysis and communication across disciplines. Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMhops-R1: Multimodal Multi-hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13573v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.</p></details> | Acceped by AAAI 2026 |
| **[KFS-Bench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Key Frame Sampling in Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14017v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.</p></details> | WACV2026 |

| **[TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14698v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://timelens-arc-lab.github.io/</p></details> |

Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://crisp-real2sim.github.io/CRISP-Real2Sim/</p></details> |

Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: First Workshop on LLM Persona Modeling (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Native and Compact Structured Latents for 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14692v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D generative modeling have significantly improved the generation realism, yet the field is still hampered by existing representations, which struggle to capture assets with complex topologies and detailed appearance. This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://microsoft.github.io/TRELLIS.2/</p></details> |
| **[MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p></details> | work in progress |

Yet it remains challenging for a humanoid robot to perform forceful manipulation tasks such as moving objects, wiping, and pushing a cart. We propose adaptive Compliance Humanoid control through hIsight Perturbation (CHIP), a plug-and-play module that enables controllable end-effector stiffness while preserving agile tracking of dynamic reference motions. CHIP is easy to implement and requires neither data augmentation nor additional reward tuning. We show that a generalist motion-tracking controller trained with CHIP can perform a diverse set of forceful manipulation tasks that require different end-effector compliance, such as multi-robot collaboration, wiping, box delivery, and door opening.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14687v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Latex...</summary><p>Latex edits, fixed typos</p></details> |
