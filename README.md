| **[A Comparative Analysis of LLM Adaptation: SFT, LoRA, and ICL in Data-Scarce Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00130v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) often need to be tailored for specific applications, requiring the integration of new knowledge or the acquisition of new skills. While full fine-tuning is a powerful adaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a degradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own trade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length, while Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best adaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce scenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully instilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general knowledge. In contrast, while SFT excels at skill acquisition, it is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. ICL is effective for incorporating factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. Our findings offer a practical framework for selecting an LLM adaptation strategy. We highlight the critical distinction between skill acquisition and knowledge integration, clarify the trade-offs between task-specific performance and the preservation of general capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Attention: A Distributed Paradigm for Collaborative LLM Inference over Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02647v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge, delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios. However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention (FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local self-attention over their own token representations while periodically exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Realignment Problem: When Right becomes Wrong in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02623v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate: large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy, identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.</p></details> | 23 Pages |
| **[Beyond the Link: Assessing LLMs' ability to Classify Political Content across Global Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17435v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in political science and digital media research. While LLMs have demonstrated ability in labelling tasks, their effectiveness to classify Political Content (PC) from URLs remains underexplored. This article evaluates whether LLMs can accurately distinguish PC from non-PC using both the text and the URLs of news articles across five countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and their different languages. Using cutting-edge models, we benchmark their performance against human-coded data to assess whether URL-level analysis can approximate full-text analysis. Our findings show that URLs embed relevant information and can serve as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to discern PC. However, we also uncover systematic biases: LLMs seem to overclassify centrist news as political, leading to false positives that may distort further analyses. We conclude by outlining methodological recommendations on the use of LLMs in political science research.</p></details> |  |
| **[How well do LLMs reason over tabular data, really?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07453v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness, robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A Survey on LLM Mid-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23081v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training. Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics, coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities. By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and innovation in the advancement of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368 economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth, unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against 100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025 data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data, while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts compared to human panels.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8-pages appendix, accepted at ICAIF 25</p></details> |
| **[Generative World Models of Tasks: LLM-Driven Hierarchical Scaffolding for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |

| **[Agent-Omni: Test-Time Multimodal Reasoning via Model Coordination for Understanding Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02834v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables.

We reframe open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative "what-if" forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An agentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM) planner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within data-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with 32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 3 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Tokens, the oft-overlooked appetizer: Large language models, the distributional hypothesis, and meaning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10924v8)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language mod-els, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance (particularly with respect to inferential lexical competence), and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model and as (2) semantic primitives. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating suboptimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence. Finally, we discuss implications for architectural choices, meaning construction, the primacy of language for thought, and LLM cognition.

| **[VidEmo: Affective-Tree Reasoning for Emotion-Centric Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02712v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Apriel-H1: Towards Efficient Enterprise Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02651v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However, transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling. State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size. These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks. We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces, achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model for Corporate Credit Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02593v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics, health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5, Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only $45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$) and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make, highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance, physics, health, and statistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph-enhanced Large Language Model for Incremental Game PlayTesting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02534v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework. The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation, the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune .</p></details> |  |

However, proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice, and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAWCAT: Efficient Distillation from Quadratic to Linear Attention with Convolution across Tokens for Long Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18467v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT (Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark (QA2\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive long-sequence training data and computational resources.

| **[XR-1: Towards Versatile Vision-Language-Action Models via Learning Unified Vision-Motion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02776v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models (VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However, existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii) aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT, UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

| **[Accumulating Context Changes the Beliefs of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01805v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model (LM) assistants are increasingly used in applications such as brainstorming and research. Improvements in memory and context size have allowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more text accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention. This comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their understanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may silently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent user experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original alignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by engaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can change the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and behaviors. Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable: GPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of discussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position. We also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool use, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief. We find that these changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that belief shifts will be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our analysis exposes the hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended sessions of talking or reading, rendering their opinions and actions unreliable.</p></details> |  |

Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 tables.

| **[Agentic World Modeling for 6G: Near-Real-Time Generative State-Space Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02748v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that sixth-generation (6G) intelligence is not fluent token prediction but the capacity to imagine and choose -- to simulate future scenarios, weigh trade-offs, and act with calibrated uncertainty. We reframe open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative "what-if" forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An agentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM) planner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within data-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with 32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 3 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
