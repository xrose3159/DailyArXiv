| **[Back to Basics: Let Denoising Generative Models Denoise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13720v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's denoising diffusion models do not "denoise" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than "$\textbf{Just image Transformers}$", or $\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model: https://huggingface.co/collections/sensenova/sensenova-si; Code: https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-SI</p></details> |
| **[TZ-LLM: Protecting On-Device Large Language Models with Arm TrustZone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13717v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices offer benefits like user privacy and reduced network latency, but introduce a significant security risk: the leakage of proprietary models to end users. To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE. Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches. We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything Across Shots: A Method and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13715v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on multi-shot semi-supervised video object segmentation (MVOS), which aims at segmenting the target object indicated by an initial mask throughout a video with multiple shots. The existing VOS methods mainly focus on single-shot videos and struggle with shot discontinuities, thereby limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions. Extensive experiments on YouMVOS and Cut-VOS demonstrate that the proposed SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mimicking, understanding, and segmenting across complex transitions. The code and datasets are released at https://henghuiding.com/SAAS/.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026, Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/SAAS/</p></details> |
| **[UnSAMv2: Self-Supervised Learning Enables Segment Anything at Any Granularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13714v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction Tuning Chronologically Consistent Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11677v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-tuned large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction tasks that is free of lookahead bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenRoboCare: A Multimodal Multi-Task Expert Demonstration Dataset for Robot Caregiving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13707v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present OpenRoboCare, a multimodal dataset for robot caregiving, capturing expert occupational therapist demonstrations of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

| **[Rare Genomic Subtype Discovery from RNA-seq via Autoencoder Embeddings and Stability-Aware Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13705v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[TiViBench: Benchmarking Think-in-Video Reasoning for Video Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13704v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of video generative models has shifted their focus from producing visually plausible outputs to tackling tasks requiring physical plausibility and logical consistency. However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page/</p></details> |
| **[ST-ProC: A Graph-Prototypical Framework for Robust Semi-Supervised Travel Mode Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13702v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Travel mode identification (TMI) from GPS trajectories is critical for urban intelligence, but is hampered by the high cost of annotation, leading to severe label scarcity. Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.</p></details> |  |

Given an RGB point cloud and a natural language prompt, our model autoregressively generates a single, coherent token sequence encoding part-level bounding boxes, semantic descriptions, and edit commands. This structured output serves as a versatile interface to drive downstream geometry-aware modules for part-based generation and editing. By decoupling the symbolic planning from the geometric synthesis, our approach allows any compatible geometry engine to be controlled through a single, language-native frontend. We pre-train a dual-encoder architecture to disentangle structure from semantics and instruction-tune the model on a large-scale, part-centric dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our model excels at producing high-quality, structured plans, enabling state-of-the-art performance in grounded Q\&A, compositional generation, and localized editing through one unified interface.

The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures,The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence(AAAI 2026),Paper has been accepted for a poster presentation</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Forgery Detection Potential of Vanilla MLLMs: A Novel Training-Free Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13442v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracing and Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Dynamic Attention Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07864v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then, we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects errors during inference with negligible overhead. Furthermore, by establishing a connection between D-LEAF and DPO, we provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness of D-LEAF. Results show our D-LEAF delivers a 53\% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4\%, substantially suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabFlash: Efficient Table Understanding with Progressive Question Conditioning and Token Focusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13283v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table images present unique challenges for effective and efficient understanding due to the need for question-specific focus and the presence of redundant background regions. Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations. To address these issues, we aim to generate visual features that are both informative and compact to improve table understanding. We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |
| **[DualTAP: A Dual-Task Adversarial Protector for Mobile MLLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13248v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliance of mobile GUI agents on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduces a severe privacy vulnerability: screenshots containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are often sent to untrusted, third-party routers. These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline. DualTAP presents the first viable solution to the privacy-utility trade-off in mobile MLLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMD-Thinker: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Thinking for Multimodal Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13242v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation floods on various social media, and continues to evolve in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC). The emerged misinformation with low creation cost and high deception poses significant threats to society. While recent studies leverage general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve remarkable results in detection, they encounter two critical limitations: (1) Insufficient reasoning, where general-purpose MLLMs often follow the uniform reasoning paradigm but generate inaccurate explanations and judgments, due to the lack of the task-specific knowledge of multimodal misinformation detection. (2) Reasoning biases, where a single thinking mode make detectors a suboptimal path for judgment, struggling to keep pace with the fast-growing and intricate multimodal misinformation. In this paper, we propose MMD-Thinker, a two-stage framework for multimodal misinformation detection through adaptive multi-dimensional thinking. First, we develop tailor-designed thinking mode for multimodal misinformation detection. Second, we adopt task-specific instruction tuning to inject the tailored thinking mode into general-purpose MLLMs. Third, we further leverage reinforcement learning strategy with a mixed advantage function, which incentivizes the reasoning capabilities in trajectories. Furthermore, we construct the multimodal misinformation reasoning (MMR) dataset, encompasses more than 8K image-text pairs with both reasoning processes and classification labels, to make progress in the relam of multimodal misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMD-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark datasets, while maintaining flexible inference and token usage. Code will be publicly available at Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Spatial Reasoning with Object-Centric 3D Rollout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13190v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding. However, enabling robust video spatial reasoning-the ability to comprehend object locations, orientations, and inter-object relationships in dynamic 3D scenes-remains a key unsolved challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines. Ablations confirm OCR's superiority over prior rollout strategies (e.g., T-GRPO, NoisyRollout).</p></details> |  |
| **[Look Before You Leap: A GUI-Critic-R1 Model for Pre-Operative Error Diagnosis in GUI Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04614v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than "$\textbf{Just image Transformers}$", or $\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

| **[Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model: https://huggingface.co/collections/sensenova/sensenova-si; Code: https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-SI</p></details> |

To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE. Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches. We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything Across Shots: A Method and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13715v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on multi-shot semi-supervised video object segmentation (MVOS), which aims at segmenting the target object indicated by an initial mask throughout a video with multiple shots. The existing VOS methods mainly focus on single-shot videos and struggle with shot discontinuities, thereby limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions. Extensive experiments on YouMVOS and Cut-VOS demonstrate that the proposed SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mimicking, understanding, and segmenting across complex transitions.

| **[UnSAMv2: Self-Supervised Learning Enables Segment Anything at Any Granularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13714v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction Tuning Chronologically Consistent Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11677v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-tuned large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction tasks that is free of lookahead bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenRoboCare: A Multimodal Multi-Task Expert Demonstration Dataset for Robot Caregiving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13707v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present OpenRoboCare, a multimodal dataset for robot caregiving, capturing expert occupational therapist demonstrations of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

| **[Rare Genomic Subtype Discovery from RNA-seq via Autoencoder Embeddings and Stability-Aware Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13705v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[TiViBench: Benchmarking Think-in-Video Reasoning for Video Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13704v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of video generative models has shifted their focus from producing visually plausible outputs to tackling tasks requiring physical plausibility and logical consistency. However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://haroldchen19.github.io/TiViBench-Page/</p></details> |

Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.</p></details> |  |
