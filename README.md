| **[Beyond Memorization: A Multi-Modal Ordinal Regression Benchmark to Expose Popularity Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21337v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Practical Automatic Piano Reduction using BERT with Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21324v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a novel automatic piano reduction method with semi-supervised machine learning. Piano reduction is an important music transformation process, which helps musicians and composers as a musical sketch for performances and analysis. The automation of such is a highly challenging research problem but could bring huge conveniences as manually doing a piano reduction takes a lot of time and effort. While supervised machine learning is often a useful tool for learning input-output mappings, it is difficult to obtain a large quantity of labelled data. We aim to solve this problem by utilizing semi-supervised learning, so that the abundant available data in classical music can be leveraged to perform the task with little or no labelling effort. In this regard, we formulate a two-step approach of music simplification followed by harmonization. We further propose and implement two possible solutions making use of an existing machine learning framework -- MidiBERT. We show that our solutions can output practical and realistic samples with an accurate reduction that needs only small adjustments in post-processing. Our study forms the groundwork for the use of semi-supervised learning in automatic piano reduction, where future researchers can take reference to produce more state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Allele-Centric Pan-Graph-Matrix Representation for Scalable Pangenome Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21320v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Solve PDEs on Neural Shape Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21311v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article webpage link: https://welschinger.github.io/Learning-to-Solve-PDEs-on-Neural-Shape-Representations/</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease using Machine Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22293v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database. Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method. Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off. Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing Decoding Paths in Masked Diffusion Models by Quantifying Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21336v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast SAM2 with Text-Driven Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21333v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures |

| **[T2AV-Compass: Towards Unified Evaluation for Text-to-Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21094v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixel Simulation: Pathology Image Generation via Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and Prototype Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21058v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 17 figures, and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Anatomy-R1: Enhancing Anatomy Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models via Anatomical Similarity Curriculum and Group Diversity Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19512v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1</p></details> |  |
| **[Pioneering Multimodal Emotion Recognition in the Era of Large Models: From Closed Sets to Open Vocabularies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20938v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multi- and cross-modal integration capabilities. However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in this context currently exists. To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems. Associated code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Driven Amodal Completion: Collaborative Agents and Perceptual Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20936v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

| **[MMSRARec: Summarization and Retrieval Augumented Sequential Recommendation Based on Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20916v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation systems. However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[M$^3$KG-RAG: Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20136v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: A Human-Inspired Image Implication Understanding and Reasoning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17019v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework: (1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark, performing comparable with the Gemini-3.0-pro model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) and outperforms the GPT-4o model 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Generalization experiments also show that our framework can effectively benefit general VQA and visual reasoning tasks. Additionally, our work provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI interaction.

| **[SpatialTree: How Spatial Abilities Branch Out in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20617v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://spatialtree.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables.

To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Practical Automatic Piano Reduction using BERT with Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21324v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a novel automatic piano reduction method with semi-supervised machine learning. Piano reduction is an important music transformation process, which helps musicians and composers as a musical sketch for performances and analysis. The automation of such is a highly challenging research problem but could bring huge conveniences as manually doing a piano reduction takes a lot of time and effort. While supervised machine learning is often a useful tool for learning input-output mappings, it is difficult to obtain a large quantity of labelled data. We aim to solve this problem by utilizing semi-supervised learning, so that the abundant available data in classical music can be leveraged to perform the task with little or no labelling effort. In this regard, we formulate a two-step approach of music simplification followed by harmonization. We further propose and implement two possible solutions making use of an existing machine learning framework -- MidiBERT. We show that our solutions can output practical and realistic samples with an accurate reduction that needs only small adjustments in post-processing. Our study forms the groundwork for the use of semi-supervised learning in automatic piano reduction, where future researchers can take reference to produce more state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Allele-Centric Pan-Graph-Matrix Representation for Scalable Pangenome Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21320v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Consulting, Data Analyst, and Management Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21316v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Solve PDEs on Neural Shape Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21311v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article webpage link: https://welschinger.github.io/Learning-to-Solve-PDEs-on-Neural-Shape-Representations/</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease using Machine Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22293v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database. Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method. Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off. Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.</p></details> |  |
