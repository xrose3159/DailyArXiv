| **[EgoScale: Scaling Dexterous Manipulation with Diverse Egocentric Human Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16710v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16708v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement. Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning. PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Mid-2025 LLM-Assistance on Novice Performance in Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16703v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a "typical" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saliency-Aware Multi-Route Thinking: Revisiting Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16702v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint 10 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Causality is Key for Interpretability Claims to Generalise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16698v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protecting the Undeleted in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16697v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.</p></details> |  |

This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reinforced Fast Weights with Next-Sequence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16704v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | AAAI2026 |
| **[Investigation for Relative Voice Impression Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14172v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Paralinguistic and non-linguistic aspects of speech strongly influence listener impressions. While most research focuses on absolute impression scoring, this study investigates relative voice impression estimation (RIE), a framework for predicting the perceptual difference between two utterances from the same speaker. The estimation target is a low-dimensional vector derived from subjective evaluations, quantifying the perceptual shift of the second utterance relative to the first along an antonymic axis (e.g., ``Dark--Bright''). To isolate expressive and prosodic variation, we used recordings of a professional speaker reading a text in various styles. We compare three modeling approaches: classical acoustic features commonly used for speech emotion recognition, self-supervised speech representations, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our results demonstrate that models using self-supervised representations outperform methods with classical acoustic features, particularly in capturing complex and dynamic impressions (e.g., ``Cold--Warm'') where classical features fail. In contrast, current MLLMs prove unreliable for this fine-grained pairwise task. This study provides the first systematic investigation of RIE and demonstrates the strength of self-supervised speech models in capturing subtle perceptual variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,3 figures, Accepted to Speech Prosody 2026</p></details> |

While these models can often give correct answers, users also need to know where those answers come from. In this work, we study structured data attribution/citation, which is the ability of the models to point to the specific rows and columns that support an answer. We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models. We also find that models are more reliable at citing rows than columns, and struggle more with textual formats than images. Finally, we observe notable differences across model families. Overall, our findings show that current mLLMs are unreliable at providing fine-grained, trustworthy attribution for structured data, which limits their usage in applications requiring transparency and traceability.</p></details> |  |

In practice, users iteratively refine visualizations through multi-turn interactions that require maintaining common ground, tracking prior edits, and adapting to evolving preferences. We introduce ChartEditBench, a benchmark for incremental, visually grounded chart editing via code, comprising 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a rigorously human-verified subset. Unlike prior one-shot benchmarks, ChartEditBench evaluates sustained, context-aware editing. We further propose a robust evaluation framework that mitigates limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge metrics by integrating execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification. Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations. ChartEditBench, establishes a challenging testbed for grounded, intent-aware multimodal programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures including Supplementary Material</p></details> |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a long-standing pillar problem in Web-scale systems and online infrastructures, such as service reliability monitoring, system fault diagnosis, and performance optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |
| **[Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Morphing Attack Detection in Open Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15461v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[One Agent to Guide Them All: Empowering MLLMs for Vision-and-Language Navigation via Explicit World Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15400v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation.</p></details> |  |

| **[EgoScale: Scaling Dexterous Manipulation with Diverse Egocentric Human Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16710v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16708v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement. Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning. PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Mid-2025 LLM-Assistance on Novice Performance in Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16703v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a "typical" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Saliency-Aware Multi-Route Thinking: Revisiting Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16702v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint 10 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Causality is Key for Interpretability Claims to Generalise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16698v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Protecting the Undeleted in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16697v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-free representations outperform single-cell foundation models on downstream benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16696v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.</p></details> |  |
