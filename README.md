| **[Contrastive Continual Learning for Model Adaptability in Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04881v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-layer Cross-Attention is Provably Optimal for Multi-modal In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04872v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel: Communication-Efficient and Deterministic MoE Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04870v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have transformed many applications but remain expensive to train. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.</p></details> |  |

Prior immersive visualization and analytics research has emphasized individual interaction, leaving open how multi-user collaboration can be supported at scale. To fill this critical gap, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 domain experts from diverse academic, government, and industry backgrounds. Using deductive-inductive hybrid thematic analysis, we identify four collaboration-focused themes: workflow challenges, adoption perceptions, prospective features, and anticipated usability and ethical risks. These findings show how current ecosystems disrupt coordination and shared understanding, while highlighting opportunities for effective multi-user engagement. Our study contributes empirical insights into collaboration practices for high-dimensional scientific data visualization and analysis, offering design implications to enhance coordination, mutual awareness, and equitable participation in next-generation collaborative immersive platforms. These contributions point toward future environments enabling distributed, cross-device teamwork on high-dimensional scientific data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted at the Proceedings of the 2026 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 26)</p></details> |
| **[Subliminal Effects in Your Data: A General Mechanism via Log-Linearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04863v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets. We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/ishaqadenali/logit-linear-selection</p></details> |
| **[Capacity Bounds on Doppler OFDM Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04862v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems experience significant Doppler effects due to high mobility. While Doppler shifts can be largely compensated, residual frequency uncertainty induces a structured form of channel uncertainty that can limit achievable rates. We model this effect using a block-fading channel of the form $ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{F} + s \mathbf{G} $, where $s$ is an unknown scalar random parameter. We first study this model in a general $N\times N$ MIMO setting. For this channel, we derive achievable rate lower bounds based on explicit transmission schemes and capacity upper bounds using a duality approach. We study Gaussian signaling and propose a practical superposition scheme with subspace alignment (SN) and successive interference cancellation, where a coarse-layer stream serves as an implicit pilot for decoding refined-layer data. We characterize asymptotic capacity in the near-coherent and high-SNR regimes, and show via Doppler-OFDM simulations that the proposed SN scheme achieves near-optimal rates with low complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ISIT 2026</p></details> |
| **[Combining Residual U-Net and Data Augmentation for Dense Temporal Segmentation of Spike Wave Discharges in Single-Channel EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00459v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual annotation of spike-wave discharges (SWDs), the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, is labor-intensive for long-term electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring studies. While machine learning approaches show promise for automated detection, they often struggle with cross-subject generalization due to high inter-individual variability in seizure morphology and signal characteristics. In this study we compare the performance of 15 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs and find that a 1D U-Net performs the best. We then improve its performance by employing residual connections and data augmentation strategies combining amplitude scaling, Gaussian noise injection, and signal inversion during training to enhance cross-subject generalization. We also compare our method, named AugUNet1D, to a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks" and show that AugUNet1D performs better on our dataset. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for other users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginal Likelihood Inference for Fitting Dynamical Survival Analysis Models to Epidemic Count Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04855v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic compartmental models are prevalent tools for describing disease spread, but inference under these models is challenging for many types of surveillance data when the marginal likelihood function becomes intractable due to missing information. To address this, we develop a closed-form likelihood for discretely observed incidence count data under the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) paradigm. The method approximates the stochastic population-level hazard by a large population limit while retaining a count-valued stochastic model, and leads to survival analytic inferential strategies that are both computationally efficient and flexible to model generalizations. Through simulation, we show that parameter estimation is competitive with recent exact but computationally expensive likelihood-based methods in partially observed settings. Previous work has shown that the DSA approximation is generalizable, and we show that the inferential developments here also carry over to models featuring individual heterogeneity, such as frailty models. We consider case studies of both Ebola and COVID-19 data on variants of the model, including a network-based epidemic model and a model with distributions over susceptibility, demonstrating its flexibility and practical utility on real, partially observed datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

| **[Capturing Visual Environment Structure Correlates with Control Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04880v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of visual representation is key to scaling generalist robot policies. However, direct evaluation via policy rollouts is expensive, even in simulation. Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.</p></details> |  |

| **[When LLaVA Meets Objects: Token Composition for Vision-Language-Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04864v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reinforced Attention Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04884v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance. We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Pyramid Network for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20322v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive computations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released at https://github.com/aihao2000/DPN-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs. Our Benchmark's anonymous repository is at https://github.com/EtaYang10th/Open-M3-Bench</p></details> |  |
| **[Alignment Drift in Multimodal LLMs: A Two-Phase, Longitudinal Evaluation of Harm Across Eight Model Releases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04739v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.</p></details> | under peer-review |

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 IEEE Radar Conference</p></details> |
| **[DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  |

However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Unimodal Shortcuts: MLLMs as Cross-Modal Reasoners for Grounded Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04486v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | GMNER |
| **[Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning for Multi-modal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04476v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.</p></details> | 18 pages; 5 figures |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p></details> |  |

| **[Contrastive Continual Learning for Model Adaptability in Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04881v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-layer Cross-Attention is Provably Optimal for Multi-modal In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04872v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.</p></details> |  |

Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.</p></details> |  |

Prior immersive visualization and analytics research has emphasized individual interaction, leaving open how multi-user collaboration can be supported at scale. To fill this critical gap, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 domain experts from diverse academic, government, and industry backgrounds. Using deductive-inductive hybrid thematic analysis, we identify four collaboration-focused themes: workflow challenges, adoption perceptions, prospective features, and anticipated usability and ethical risks. These findings show how current ecosystems disrupt coordination and shared understanding, while highlighting opportunities for effective multi-user engagement. Our study contributes empirical insights into collaboration practices for high-dimensional scientific data visualization and analysis, offering design implications to enhance coordination, mutual awareness, and equitable participation in next-generation collaborative immersive platforms. These contributions point toward future environments enabling distributed, cross-device teamwork on high-dimensional scientific data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted at the Proceedings of the 2026 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 26)</p></details> |
| **[Subliminal Effects in Your Data: A General Mechanism via Log-Linearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04863v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets. We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/ishaqadenali/logit-linear-selection</p></details> |
| **[Capacity Bounds on Doppler OFDM Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04862v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems experience significant Doppler effects due to high mobility. While Doppler shifts can be largely compensated, residual frequency uncertainty induces a structured form of channel uncertainty that can limit achievable rates. We model this effect using a block-fading channel of the form $ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{F} + s \mathbf{G} $, where $s$ is an unknown scalar random parameter. We first study this model in a general $N\times N$ MIMO setting. For this channel, we derive achievable rate lower bounds based on explicit transmission schemes and capacity upper bounds using a duality approach. We study Gaussian signaling and propose a practical superposition scheme with subspace alignment (SN) and successive interference cancellation, where a coarse-layer stream serves as an implicit pilot for decoding refined-layer data. We characterize asymptotic capacity in the near-coherent and high-SNR regimes, and show via Doppler-OFDM simulations that the proposed SN scheme achieves near-optimal rates with low complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ISIT 2026</p></details> |
| **[Combining Residual U-Net and Data Augmentation for Dense Temporal Segmentation of Spike Wave Discharges in Single-Channel EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00459v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual annotation of spike-wave discharges (SWDs), the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, is labor-intensive for long-term electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring studies. While machine learning approaches show promise for automated detection, they often struggle with cross-subject generalization due to high inter-individual variability in seizure morphology and signal characteristics. In this study we compare the performance of 15 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs and find that a 1D U-Net performs the best. We then improve its performance by employing residual connections and data augmentation strategies combining amplitude scaling, Gaussian noise injection, and signal inversion during training to enhance cross-subject generalization. We also compare our method, named AugUNet1D, to a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks" and show that AugUNet1D performs better on our dataset. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for other users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginal Likelihood Inference for Fitting Dynamical Survival Analysis Models to Epidemic Count Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04855v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic compartmental models are prevalent tools for describing disease spread, but inference under these models is challenging for many types of surveillance data when the marginal likelihood function becomes intractable due to missing information. To address this, we develop a closed-form likelihood for discretely observed incidence count data under the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) paradigm. The method approximates the stochastic population-level hazard by a large population limit while retaining a count-valued stochastic model, and leads to survival analytic inferential strategies that are both computationally efficient and flexible to model generalizations. Through simulation, we show that parameter estimation is competitive with recent exact but computationally expensive likelihood-based methods in partially observed settings. Previous work has shown that the DSA approximation is generalizable, and we show that the inferential developments here also carry over to models featuring individual heterogeneity, such as frailty models. We consider case studies of both Ebola and COVID-19 data on variants of the model, including a network-based epidemic model and a model with distributions over susceptibility, demonstrating its flexibility and practical utility on real, partially observed datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
