| **[A Survey of LLM $\times$ DATA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18458v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please refer to the paper list at: https://github.com/weAIDB/awesome-data-llm</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Powered Proactive Data Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13016v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the power of LLMs, we now have the ability to query data that was previously impossible to query, including text, images, and video. However, despite this enormous potential, most present-day data systems that leverage LLMs are reactive, reflecting our community's desire to map LLMs to known abstractions. Most data systems treat LLMs as an opaque black box that operates on user inputs and data as is, optimizing them much like any other approximate, expensive UDFs, in conjunction with other relational operators. Such data systems do as they are told, but fail to understand and leverage what the LLM is being asked to do (i.e. the underlying operations, which may be error-prone), the data the LLM is operating on (e.g., long, complex documents), or what the user really needs. They don't take advantage of the characteristics of the operations and/or the data at hand, or ensure correctness of results when there are imprecisions and ambiguities. We argue that data systems instead need to be proactive: they need to be given more agency -- armed with the power of LLMs -- to understand and rework the user inputs and the data and to make decisions on how the operations and the data should be represented and processed. By allowing the data system to parse, rewrite, and decompose user inputs and data, or to interact with the user in ways that go beyond the standard single-shot query-result paradigm, the data system is able to address user needs more efficiently and effectively. These new capabilities lead to a rich design space where the data system takes more initiative: they are empowered to perform optimization based on the transformation operations, data characteristics, and user intent. We discuss various successful examples of how this framework has been and can be applied in real-world tasks, and present future directions for this ambitious research agenda.</p></details> |  |
| **[On LLMs-Driven Synthetic Data Generation, Curation, and Evaluation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15126v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the evolving landscape of deep learning, the dilemma of data quantity and quality has been a long-standing problem. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a data-centric solution to alleviate the limitations of real-world data with synthetic data generation. However, current investigations into this field lack a unified framework and mostly stay on the surface. Therefore, this paper provides an organization of relevant studies based on a generic workflow of synthetic data generation. By doing so, we highlight the gaps within existing research and outline prospective avenues for future study. This work aims to shepherd the academic and industrial communities towards deeper, more methodical inquiries into the capabilities and applications of LLMs-driven synthetic data generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sur...</summary><p>A survey on LLMs-driven synthetic data generation, curation and evaluation</p></details> |
| **[LLMs with User-defined Prompts as Generic Data Operators for Reliable Data Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16351v1)** | 2023-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data processing is one of the fundamental steps in machine learning pipelines to ensure data quality. Majority of the applications consider the user-defined function (UDF) design pattern for data processing in databases. Although the UDF design pattern introduces flexibility, reusability and scalability, the increasing demand on machine learning pipelines brings three new challenges to this design pattern -- not low-code, not dependency-free and not knowledge-aware. To address these challenges, we propose a new design pattern that large language models (LLMs) could work as a generic data operator (LLM-GDO) for reliable data cleansing, transformation and modeling with their human-compatible performance. In the LLM-GDO design pattern, user-defined prompts (UDPs) are used to represent the data processing logic rather than implementations with a specific programming language. LLMs can be centrally maintained so users don't have to manage the dependencies at the run-time. Fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data could enhance the performance on the domain-specific tasks which makes data processing knowledge-aware. We illustrate these advantages with examples in different data processing tasks. Furthermore, we summarize the challenges and opportunities introduced by LLMs to provide a complete view of this design pattern for more discussions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures, 1st IEEE International Workshop on Data Engineering and Modeling for AI (DEMAI), IEEE BigData 2023</p></details> |
| **[Synthesizing Privacy-Preserving Text Data via Finetuning without Finetuning Billion-Scale LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12347v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data offers a promising path to train models while preserving data privacy. Differentially private (DP) finetuning of large language models (LLMs) as data generator is effective, but is impractical when computation resources are limited. Meanwhile, prompt-based methods such as private evolution depend heavily on the manual prompts, and ineffectively use private information in their iterative data selection process. To overcome these limitations, we propose CTCL (Data Synthesis with ConTrollability and CLustering), a novel framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data without extensive prompt engineering or billion-scale LLM finetuning. CTCL pretrains a lightweight 140M conditional generator and a clustering-based topic model on large-scale public data. To further adapt to the private domain, the generator is DP finetuned on private data for fine-grained textual information, while the topic model extracts a DP histogram representing distributional information. The DP generator then samples according to the DP histogram to synthesize a desired number of data examples. Evaluation across five diverse domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in the strong privacy regime. Systematic ablation validates the design of each framework component and highlights the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/tanyuqian/synthetic-private-data</p></details> |
| **[Exploring LLM Capabilities in Extracting DCAT-Compatible Metadata for Data Cataloging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05282v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data. Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of task-specific criteria and domain context.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Data Science Agents: A Survey of Capabilities, Challenges, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04023v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code, tables, and visuals. This survey presents the first comprehensive, lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection, interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization, and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability, governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency, transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey paper; 45 data science agents; under review</p></details> |
| **[On Reality and the Limits of Language Data: Aligning LLMs with Human Norms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11981v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) harness linguistic associations in vast natural language data for practical applications. However, their ability to understand the physical world using only language data remains a question. After reviewing existing protocols, we explore this question using a novel and tightly controlled reasoning test (ART) and compare human norms against versions of GPT-3. Our findings highlight the categories of common-sense relations models that could learn directly from data and areas of weakness. GPT-3 offers evidence for verbal reasoning on a par with human subjects for several relations including Synonymy, Antonymy, and Default inheritance, Without reinforcement learning from human judgements, it appears GPT-3 performs at the lower end of the reference interval for Has-part and Contained-in. Weaknesses were observed also in affordance characteristics through Necessary-quality, Order-of-size and Order-of-intensity. Combining LLMs with symbolic world grounding is a promising direction to address associative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; data available, see https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/projects/art</p></details> |
| **[DALDA: Data Augmentation Leveraging Diffusion Model and LLM with Adaptive Guidance Scaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16949v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an effective data augmentation framework leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) and Diffusion Model (DM) to tackle the challenges inherent in data-scarce scenarios. Recently, DMs have opened up the possibility of generating synthetic images to complement a few training images. However, increasing the diversity of synthetic images also raises the risk of generating samples outside the target distribution. Our approach addresses this issue by embedding novel semantic information into text prompts via LLM and utilizing real images as visual prompts, thus generating semantically rich images. To ensure that the generated images remain within the target distribution, we dynamically adjust the guidance weight based on each image's CLIPScore to control the diversity. Experimental results show that our method produces synthetic images with enhanced diversity while maintaining adherence to the target distribution. Consequently, our approach proves to be more efficient in the few-shot setting on several benchmarks.

| **[Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09599v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/PTTS</p></details> |

| **[MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol RTL-to-GDSII Automation with Backend Aware Synthesis Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19570v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents MCP4EDA, the first Model Context Protocol server that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the complete open-source RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interaction. The system integrates Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization into a unified LLM-accessible interface, enabling designers to execute complex multi-tool EDA workflows conversationally via AI assistants such as Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE. The principal contribution is a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology wherein LLMs analyze actual post-layout timing, power, and area metrics from OpenLane results to iteratively refine synthesis TCL scripts, establishing a closed-loop optimization system that bridges the traditional gap between synthesis estimates and physical implementation reality. In contrast to conventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages real backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization sequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an intelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on representative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing closure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows, establishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end open-source EDA automation system. The code and demo are avaiable at: http://www.agent4eda.com/</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures Keywords: Model Context Protocol, Electronic Design Automation, Large Language Models, Synthesis Optimization</p></details> |
| **[Are LLMs Any Good for High-Level Synthesis?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10428v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity and demand for faster, energy-efficient hardware designs necessitate innovative High-Level Synthesis (HLS) methodologies. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline or replace the HLS process, leveraging their ability to understand natural language specifications and refactor code. We survey the current research and conduct experiments comparing Verilog designs generated by a standard HLS tool (Vitis HLS) with those produced by LLMs translating C code or natural language specifications. Our evaluation focuses on quantifying the impact on performance, power, and resource utilization, providing an assessment of the efficiency of LLM-based approaches. This study aims to illuminate the role of LLMs in HLS, identifying promising directions for optimized hardware design in applications such as AI acceleration, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCAD...</summary><p>ICCAD '24 Special Session on AI4HLS: New Frontiers in High-Level Synthesis Augmented with Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[GraphMaster: Automated Graph Synthesis via LLM Agents in Data-Limited Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00711v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The era of foundation models has revolutionized AI research, yet Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale graph corpora. Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLAMES: Improving LLM Math Reasoning via a Fine-Grained Analysis of the Data Synthesis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16514v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems. To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments, we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies, outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LLMs Matches Large LLMs in Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12322v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering LLMs in Decision Games through Algorithmic Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13980v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across numerous domains, yet they often struggle with complex reasoning and decision-making tasks. Decision-making games, which inherently require multifaceted reasoning logic, serve as ideal sandboxes for evaluating and enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we first explore whether LLMs can master complex decision-making games through targeted post-training. To this end, we design data synthesis strategies and curate extensive offline datasets from two classic games, Doudizhu and Go. We further develop a suite of techniques to effectively incorporate this data into LLM training, resulting in two novel agents: Mastermind-Dou and Mastermind-Go. Our experimental results demonstrate that these Mastermind LLMs achieve competitive performance in their respective games. Additionally, we explore whether integrating decision-making data can enhance the general reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings suggest that such post-training improves certain aspects of reasoning, providing valuable insights for optimizing LLM data collection and synthesis strategies.</p></details> |  |

We present LiteLong, a resource-efficient method for synthesizing long-context data through structured topic organization and multi-agent debate. Our approach leverages the BISAC book classification system to provide a comprehensive hierarchical topic organization, and then employs a debate mechanism with multiple LLMs to generate diverse, high-quality topics within this structure. For each topic, we use lightweight BM25 retrieval to obtain relevant documents and concatenate them into 128K-token training samples. Experiments on HELMET and Ruler benchmarks demonstrate that LiteLong achieves competitive long-context performance and can seamlessly integrate with other long-dependency enhancement methods. LiteLong makes high-quality long-context data synthesis more accessible by reducing both computational and data engineering costs, facilitating further research in long-context language training.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12726v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, and lack guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instruct LLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling automated synthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with source documents, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Using this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families. Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing datasets. Notably, after SFT on our datasets, the base versions of these models even surpass their official instruction-tuned counterparts.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover, customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks.

However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

The text describes actions performed on the scene that is depicted in the image. Since the question posed may not be about the scene in the image, but about the state of the scene before or after the actions are applied, the solver envision or imagine the state changes due to these actions. Solving these word problems requires a combination of language, visual and mathematical reasoning.

| **[STEM-POM: Evaluating Language Models Math-Symbol Reasoning in Document Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00387v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred research into enhancing their reasoning capabilities, particularly in math-rich STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) documents. While LLMs can generate equations or solve math-related queries, their ability to fully understand and interpret abstract mathematical symbols in long, math-rich documents remains limited. In this paper, we introduce STEM-PoM, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on math symbols within contextual scientific text. The dataset, sourced from real-world ArXiv documents, contains over 2K math symbols classified as main attributes of variables, constants, operators, and unit descriptors, with additional sub-attributes including scalar/vector/matrix for variables and local/global/discipline-specific labels for both constants and operators. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve an average accuracy of 20-60% under in-context learning and 50-60% with fine-tuning, highlighting a substantial gap in their ability to classify mathematical symbols. By improving LLMs' mathematical symbol classification, STEM-PoM further enhances models' downstream mathematical reasoning capabilities. The code and data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/STEM-PoM.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025; NeurIPS Math-AI 2024; Code and Data: https://github.com/jiaruzouu/STEM-PoM</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

However, a growing concern lies in their tendency to produce excessively long reasoning traces, which are often filled with redundant content (e.g., repeated definitions), over-analysis of simple problems, and superficial exploration of multiple reasoning paths for harder tasks. This inefficiency introduces significant challenges for training, inference, and real-world deployment (e.g., in agent-based systems), where token economy is critical. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent efforts aimed at improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with a particular focus on the unique challenges that arise in this new paradigm. We identify common patterns of inefficiency, examine methods proposed across the LRM lifecycle, i.e., from pretraining to inference, and discuss promising future directions for research. To support ongoing development, we also maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking recent progress in the field. We hope this survey serves as a foundation for further exploration and inspires innovation in this rapidly evolving area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey, 32 pages, Large Reasoning Models, Efficient Reasoning for Language, Multimodality, and Beyond</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce and open-source our math reasoning LLMs InternLM-Math which is continue pre-trained from InternLM2. We unify chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling, formal reasoning, data augmentation, and code interpreter in a unified seq2seq format and supervise our model to be a versatile math reasoner, verifier, prover, and augmenter. These abilities can be used to develop the next math LLMs or self-iteration. InternLM-Math obtains open-sourced state-of-the-art performance under the setting of in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and code-assisted reasoning in various informal and formal benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH, Hungary math exam, MathBench-ZH, and MiniF2F. Our pre-trained model achieves 30.3 on the MiniF2F test set without fine-tuning. We further explore how to use LEAN to solve math problems and study its performance under the setting of multi-task learning which shows the possibility of using LEAN as a unified platform for solving and proving in math.

Existing efficient reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 39th NeurIPS - Foundations of Reasoning in Language Models</p></details> |

However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 54 figures, Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

Abductive reasoning is a form of logical inference in which a hypothesis is formulated from a set of observations, and that hypothesis is used to explain the observations. The ability to formulate such hypotheses is important for lawyers and legal scholars as it helps them articulate logical arguments, interpret laws, and develop legal theories. Our motivation is to consider the belief that deep learning models, especially large language models (LLMs), will soon replace lawyers because they perform well on tasks related to legal text processing. But to do so, we believe, requires some form of abductive hypothesis formation. In other words, while LLMs become more popular and powerful, we want to investigate their capacity for abductive reasoning. To pursue this goal, we start by building a logic-augmented dataset for abductive reasoning with 498,697 samples and then use it to evaluate the performance of a SOTA model in the legal field. Our experimental results show that although these models can perform well on tasks related to some aspects of legal text processing, they still fall short in supporting abductive reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Logic Programming and Legal Reasoning, @ICLP 2023</p></details> |

| **[A Survey on Data Selection for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16827v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major factor in the recent success of large language models is the use of enormous and ever-growing text datasets for unsupervised pre-training. However, naively training a model on all available data may not be optimal (or feasible), as the quality of available text data can vary. Filtering out data can also decrease the carbon footprint and financial costs of training models by reducing the amount of training required. Data selection methods aim to determine which candidate data points to include in the training dataset and how to appropriately sample from the selected data points. The promise of improved data selection methods has caused the volume of research in the area to rapidly expand. However, because deep learning is mostly driven by empirical evidence and experimentation on large-scale data is expensive, few organizations have the resources for extensive data selection research. Consequently, knowledge of effective data selection practices has become concentrated within a few organizations, many of which do not openly share their findings and methodologies. To narrow this gap in knowledge, we present a comprehensive review of existing literature on data selection methods and related research areas, providing a taxonomy of existing approaches. By describing the current landscape of research, this work aims to accelerate progress in data selection by establishing an entry point for new and established researchers. Additionally, throughout this review we draw attention to noticeable holes in the literature and conclude the paper by proposing promising avenues for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper list available at https://github.com/alon-albalak/data-selection-survey</p></details> |
| **[QuRating: Selecting High-Quality Data for Training Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09739v3)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting high-quality pre-training data is important for creating capable language models, but existing methods rely on simple heuristics. We introduce QuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that can capture human intuitions about data quality. In this paper, we investigate four qualities - writing style, required expertise, facts & trivia, and educational value - and find that LLMs are able to discern these qualities, especially when making pairwise judgments of texts. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratings from pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus with quality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select 30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameter language models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balance quality and diversity. When we sample using quality ratings as logits over documents, our models obtain lower perplexity and stronger in-context learning performance than baselines. Our best model is based on educational value and performs similarly to a model trained with uniform sampling for 50% more steps. Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a training curriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset. We extensively analyze the quality ratings and discuss their characteristics, biases, and wider implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024.

Despite generating high-quality images, existing methods are limited in relying mainly on text control conditions, and thus do not always generate images accurately and stably. In this paper, we propose CRS-Diff, a new RS generative framework specifically tailored for RS image generation, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models while integrating more advanced control mechanisms. Specifically, CRS-Diff can simultaneously support text-condition, metadata-condition, and image-condition control inputs, thus enabling more precise control to refine the generation process. To effectively integrate multiple condition control information, we introduce a new conditional control mechanism to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, thus enhancing the guiding effect of control conditions. To our knowledge, CRS-Diff is the first multiple-condition controllable RS generative model. Experimental results in single-condition and multiple-condition cases have demonstrated the superior ability of our CRS-Diff to generate RS images both quantitatively and qualitatively compared with previous methods. Additionally, our CRS-Diff can serve as a data engine that generates high-quality training data for downstream tasks, e.g., road extraction. The code is available at https://github.com/Sonettoo/CRS-Diff.</p></details> |  |

These models are not empirically identifiable without exclusion restrictions. In other words, some variables predictive of missingness do not affect the outcome model of interest. The drive to establish this requirement often leads to the inclusion of irrelevant variables in the model. A recent proposal uses adaptive LASSO to circumvent this problem, but its performance depends on the so-called covariance assumption, which can be violated in small to moderate samples. Additionally, there are no tools yet for post-selection inference for this model. To address these challenges, we propose two families of spike-and-slab priors to conduct Bayesian variable selection in sample selection models. These prior structures allow for constructing a Gibbs sampler with tractable conditionals, which is scalable to the dimensions of practical interest. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology through a simulation study and present a comparison against adaptive LASSO and stepwise selection. We also provide two applications using publicly available real data. An implementation and code to reproduce the results in this paper can be found at https://github.com/adam-iqbal/selection-spike-slab.</p></details> | <details><summary>An im...</summary><p>An implementation and code used to reproduce simulation studies and the real data applications can be found at https://github.com/adam-iqbal/selection-spike-slab</p></details> |

In fact, the information contained in data often includes sensitive and personally identifiable details. This data, if not safeguarded, may bring privacy risks in terms of both disclosure and identification. Furthermore, the application of anonymisation techniques, such as k-anonymity, can lead to a significant reduction in the amount of data within data sources, which may reduce the efficacy of predictive processes. In our study, we investigate the capabilities offered by LLMs to enrich anonymized data sources without affecting their anonymity. To this end, we designed new ad-hoc prompt template engineering strategies to perform anonymized Data Augmentation and assess the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches in providing anonymized data. To validate the anonymization guarantees provided by LLMs, we exploited the pyCanon library, designed to assess the values of the parameters associated with the most common privacy-preserving techniques via anonymization. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMs yield promising results for this goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stefa...</summary><p>Stefano Cirillo, Domenico Desiato, Giuseppe Polese, Monica Maria Lucia Sebillo, Giandomenico Solimando: Augmenting Anonymized Data with AI: Exploring the Feasibility and Limitations of Large Language Models in Data Enrichment.

However, choosing suitable cluster resources for distributed dataflow jobs in both type and number is difficult, especially for users who do not have access to previous performance metrics. One approach to overcoming this issue is to have users share runtime metrics to train context-aware performance models that help find a suitable configuration for the job at hand. A problem when sharing runtime data instead of trained models or model parameters is that the data size can grow substantially over time. This paper examines several clustering techniques to minimize training data size while keeping the associated performance models accurate. Our results indicate that efficiency gains in data transfer, storage, and model training can be achieved through training data reduction. In the evaluation of our solution on a dataset of runtime data from 930 unique distributed dataflow jobs, we observed that, on average, a 75% data reduction only increases prediction errors by one percentage point.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for the BPOD Workshop at IEEE Big Data 2021</p></details> |

We advocate for the prior which maximizes the mutual information between parameters and predictions, learning as much as possible from limited data. When many parameters are poorly constrained by the available data, we find that this prior puts weight only on boundaries of the parameter manifold. Thus it selects a lower-dimensional effective theory in a principled way, ignoring irrelevant parameter directions. In the limit where there is sufficient data to tightly constrain any number of parameters, this reduces to Jeffreys prior. But we argue that this limit is pathological when applied to the hyper-ribbon parameter manifolds generic in science, because it leads to dramatic dependence on effects invisible to experiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures. v3 has improved discussion and adds an appendix about MDL and Bayes factors, and matches version to appear in PNAS (modulo comma placement).

An important decision is then on the choice of a suitable dose response function to support dose selection for the subsequent Phase III studies. In this paper we compare different approaches for model selection and model averaging using mathematical properties as well as simulations. Accordingly, we review and illustrate asymptotic properties of model selection criteria and investigate their behavior when changing the sample size but keeping the effect size constant. In a large scale simulation study we investigate how the various approaches perform in realistically chosen settings. Finally, the different methods are illustrated with a recently conducted Phase II dosefinding study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords and Phrases: Model selection; model averaging; clinical trials; simulation study</p></details> |
