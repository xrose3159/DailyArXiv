| **[Tuning-free Visual Effect Transfer across Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07833v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

| **[Video Generation Models in Robotics - Applications, Research Challenges, Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07823v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotically well-calibrated Bayesian $p$-value using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14077v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The posterior predictive $p$-value (ppp) is widely used in Bayesian model evaluation. However, due to double use of the data, the ppp may not be a valid $p$-value even in large samples: The asymptotic null distribution of the ppp can be non-uniform unless the underlying test statistic satisfies certain well-calibration conditions. Such conditions have been studied in the literature for asymptotically normal test statistics. We extend this line of work by establishing well-calibration conditions for test statistics that are not necessarily asymptotically normal. In particular, we show that Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)-type test statistics satisfy these conditions, such that their ppps are asymptotically well-calibrated Bayesian $p$-values. KS-type statistics are versatile, omnibus, and sensitive to model misspecifications. They apply to i.i.d. real-valued data, as well as non-identically distributed observations under regression models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that such $p$-values are well behaved in finite samples and can effectively detect a wide range of alternative models.</p></details> |  |

From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment can yield substantially narrower prediction intervals at a fixed target coverage, particularly on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling is informative. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners assess when and why intervals shrink. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS achieves nominal coverage and offers the most efficient intervals on small to medium datasets with mild heterogeneity, while remaining competitive and diagnostically transparent on large-scale heterogeneous data where Normalized-CP and CQR attain the tightest intervals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for clarity and correctness; improved exposition and fixed minor issues</p></details> |
| **[EEG-to-fMRI synthesis of task-evoked and spontaneous brain activity: addressing issues of statistical significance and generalizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10752v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing interest has developed in the problem of training models of EEG features to predict brain activity measured using fMRI, i.e. the problem of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis. Despite some reported success, the statistical significance and generalizability of EEG-to-fMRI predictions remains to be fully demonstrated. Here, we investigate the predictive power of EEG for both task-evoked and spontaneous activity of the somatomotor network measured by fMRI, based on data collected from healthy subjects in two different sessions. We trained subject-specific distributed-lag linear models of time-varying, multi-channel EEG spectral power using Sparse Group LASSO regularization, and we showed that learned models outperformed conventional EEG somatomotor rhythm predictors as well as massive univariate correlation models. Furthermore, we showed that learned models were statistically significantly better than appropriate null models in most subjects and conditions, although less frequently for spontaneous compared to task-evoked activity. Critically, predictions improved significantly when training and testing on data acquired in the same session relative to across sessions, highlighting the importance of temporally separating the collection of train and test data to avoid data leakage and optimistic bias in model generalization. In sum, while we demonstrate that EEG models can provide fMRI predictions with statistical significance, we also show that predictive power is impaired for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity and for models trained on data acquired in a different session. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly consider these often overlooked issues in the growing literature of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORACLE: Explaining Feature Interactions in Neural Networks with ANOVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10825v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ORACLE, a framework for explaining neural networks on tabular data and scientific factorial designs. ORACLE summarizes a trained network's prediction surface with main effects and pairwise interactions by treating the network as a black-box response, discretizing the inputs onto a grid, and fitting an orthogonal factorial (ANOVA-style) surrogate -- the $L^2$ orthogonal projection of the model response onto a finite-dimensional factorial subspace. A simple centering and $μ$-rebalancing step then expresses this surrogate as main- and interaction-effect tables that remain faithful to the original model in the $L^2$ sense. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly aligned with classical design-of-experiments practice. On synthetic factorial benchmarks and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression tasks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth interaction structure and hotspots than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability. We also discuss its scope in latent image and text settings: grid-based factorial surrogates are most effective when features admit an interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering workflows that require stable DoE-style interaction summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: R...</summary><p>v4: Revised for clarity and correctness; improved exposition and fixed minor issues</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven control of hydraulic impact hammers under strict operational and control constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07813v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The code will be released here.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables, Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[PlaM: Training-Free Plateau-Guided Model Merging for Better Visual Grounding in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07645v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on strong linguistic reasoning inherited from their base language models. However, multimodal instruction fine-tuning paradoxically degrades this text's reasoning capability, undermining multimodal performance. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework to mitigate this degradation. Through layer-wise vision token masking, we reveal a common three-stage pattern in multimodal large language models: early-modal separation, mid-modal alignment, and late-modal degradation. By analyzing the behavior of MLLMs at different stages, we propose a plateau-guided model merging method that selectively injects base language model parameters into MLLMs. Experimental results based on five MLLMs on nine benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Attention-based analysis further reveals that merging shifts attention from diffuse, scattered patterns to focused localization on task-relevant visual regions. Our repository is on https://github.com/wzj1718/PlaM.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Seeing Right but Saying Wrong: Inter- and Intra-Layer Refinement in MLLMs without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07359v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, their internal reasoning often exhibits a critical inconsistency: although deeper layers may attend to the correct visual regions, final predictions are frequently misled by noisy attention from earlier layers. This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mimic Human Cognition, Master Multi-Image Reasoning: A Meta-Action Framework for Enhanced Visual Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07298v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at single-image understanding, they exhibit significantly degraded performance in multi-image reasoning scenarios. Multi-image reasoning presents fundamental challenges including complex inter-relationships between images and scattered critical information across image sets. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose the Cognition-Inspired Meta-Action Framework (CINEMA), a novel approach that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions: Global, Focus, Hint, Think, and Answer which explicitly modeling the sequential cognitive steps humans naturally employ. For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks. Our model surpasses GPT-4o on the MUIR and MVMath benchmarks and notably outperforms specialized video reasoning models on video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our human cognition-inspired reasoning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13772v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A3: Android Agent Arena for Mobile GUI Agents with Essential-State Procedural Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01149v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has catalyzed the development of mobile graphic user interface (GUI) AI agents, which is designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices. However, a significant gap persists in mobile GUI agent evaluation, where existing benchmarks predominantly rely on either static frame assessments such as AndroidControl or offline static apps such as AndroidWorld and thus fail to capture agent performance in dynamic, real-world online mobile apps. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel "essential-state" based procedural evaluation system for mobile GUI agents. A3 introduces a benchmark of 100 tasks derived from 20 widely-used, dynamic online apps across 20 categories from the Google Play Store, ensuring evaluation comprehension. A3 also presents a novel "essential-state" based procedural evaluation method that leverages MLLMs as reward models to progressively verify task completion and process achievement. This evaluation approach address the limitations of traditional function based evaluation methods on online dynamic apps. Furthermore, A3 includes a toolkit to streamline Android device interaction, reset online environment and apps and facilitate data collection from both human and agent demonstrations. The complete A3 system, including the benchmark and tools, will be publicly released to provide a robust foundation for future research and development in mobile GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Trustworthy Dermatology MLLMs: A Benchmark and Multimodal Evaluator for Diagnostic Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09195v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Findings with Diagnosis: A Self-Consistent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Trustworthy Radiology Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03321v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Textual Reasoning Improve the Performance of MLLMs on Fine-grained Visual Classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06993v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose capabilities, yet still struggle on Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC), a core perception task that requires subtle visual discrimination and is crucial for many real-world applications. A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our findings and the proposed ReFine-RFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks.

A Benchmark for Multimodal UI/UX Design Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05026v4)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User interface (UI) design goes beyond visuals to shape user experience (UX), underscoring the shift toward UI/UX as a unified concept. While recent studies have explored UI evaluation using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they largely focus on surface-level features, overlooking how design choices influence user behavior at scale. To fill this gap, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a novel benchmark for multimodal understanding of how UI/UX design affects user behavior, built on 300 real-world UI image pairs from industry A/B tests, with empirically validated winners that induced more user actions. For future design progress in practice, post-hoc understanding of why such winners succeed with mass users is also required; we support this via expert-curated key interpretations for each instance. Experiments across multiple MLLMs on WiserUI-Bench for two main tasks, (1) predicting the more effective UI image between an A/B-tested pair, and (2) explaining it post-hoc in alignment with expert interpretations, show that models exhibit limited understanding of the behavioral impact of UI/UX design. We believe our work will foster research on leveraging MLLMs for visual design in user behavior contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 24 figures, Our code and dataset: https://github.com/jeochris/wiserui-bench</p></details> |

| **[Tuning-free Visual Effect Transfer across Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07833v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

| **[Video Generation Models in Robotics - Applications, Research Challenges, Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07823v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotically well-calibrated Bayesian $p$-value using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14077v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The posterior predictive $p$-value (ppp) is widely used in Bayesian model evaluation. However, due to double use of the data, the ppp may not be a valid $p$-value even in large samples: The asymptotic null distribution of the ppp can be non-uniform unless the underlying test statistic satisfies certain well-calibration conditions. Such conditions have been studied in the literature for asymptotically normal test statistics. We extend this line of work by establishing well-calibration conditions for test statistics that are not necessarily asymptotically normal. In particular, we show that Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)-type test statistics satisfy these conditions, such that their ppps are asymptotically well-calibrated Bayesian $p$-values. KS-type statistics are versatile, omnibus, and sensitive to model misspecifications. They apply to i.i.d. real-valued data, as well as non-identically distributed observations under regression models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that such $p$-values are well behaved in finite samples and can effectively detect a wide range of alternative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: Posterior-Aware Conformal Intervals via Last-Layer Laplace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01384v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment can yield substantially narrower prediction intervals at a fixed target coverage, particularly on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling is informative. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners assess when and why intervals shrink. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS achieves nominal coverage and offers the most efficient intervals on small to medium datasets with mild heterogeneity, while remaining competitive and diagnostically transparent on large-scale heterogeneous data where Normalized-CP and CQR attain the tightest intervals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for clarity and correctness; improved exposition and fixed minor issues</p></details> |
| **[EEG-to-fMRI synthesis of task-evoked and spontaneous brain activity: addressing issues of statistical significance and generalizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10752v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing interest has developed in the problem of training models of EEG features to predict brain activity measured using fMRI, i.e. the problem of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis. Despite some reported success, the statistical significance and generalizability of EEG-to-fMRI predictions remains to be fully demonstrated. Here, we investigate the predictive power of EEG for both task-evoked and spontaneous activity of the somatomotor network measured by fMRI, based on data collected from healthy subjects in two different sessions. We trained subject-specific distributed-lag linear models of time-varying, multi-channel EEG spectral power using Sparse Group LASSO regularization, and we showed that learned models outperformed conventional EEG somatomotor rhythm predictors as well as massive univariate correlation models. Furthermore, we showed that learned models were statistically significantly better than appropriate null models in most subjects and conditions, although less frequently for spontaneous compared to task-evoked activity. Critically, predictions improved significantly when training and testing on data acquired in the same session relative to across sessions, highlighting the importance of temporally separating the collection of train and test data to avoid data leakage and optimistic bias in model generalization. In sum, while we demonstrate that EEG models can provide fMRI predictions with statistical significance, we also show that predictive power is impaired for spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity and for models trained on data acquired in a different session. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly consider these often overlooked issues in the growing literature of EEG-to-fMRI synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORACLE: Explaining Feature Interactions in Neural Networks with ANOVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10825v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ORACLE, a framework for explaining neural networks on tabular data and scientific factorial designs. ORACLE summarizes a trained network's prediction surface with main effects and pairwise interactions by treating the network as a black-box response, discretizing the inputs onto a grid, and fitting an orthogonal factorial (ANOVA-style) surrogate -- the $L^2$ orthogonal projection of the model response onto a finite-dimensional factorial subspace. A simple centering and $μ$-rebalancing step then expresses this surrogate as main- and interaction-effect tables that remain faithful to the original model in the $L^2$ sense. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly aligned with classical design-of-experiments practice. On synthetic factorial benchmarks and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression tasks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth interaction structure and hotspots than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability. We also discuss its scope in latent image and text settings: grid-based factorial surrogates are most effective when features admit an interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering workflows that require stable DoE-style interaction summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: R...</summary><p>v4: Revised for clarity and correctness; improved exposition and fixed minor issues</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven control of hydraulic impact hammers under strict operational and control constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07813v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |
