| **[Evaluation of Oncotimia: An LLM based system for supporting tumour boards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19899v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **["Not in My Backyard": LLMs Uncover Online and Offline Social Biases Against Homelessnes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13187v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence in Spanish Gastroenterology: high expectations, limited integration. A national survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17011v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive innovation in medicine, yet its adoption within gastroenterology remains limited and poorly characterized. We aimed to examine knowledge, practical applications, perceived barriers, and expectations regarding AI among gastroenterology specialists in Spain. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a structured online survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology (SEPD) in 2025. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, patterns of AI use, perceptions, and educational needs. Descriptive statistics and multivariable models were applied. Results: Among 283 respondents (mean age 44.6 +/- 9.7 years), 87.5% acknowledged AI as a transformative tool, but only 60.2% (95% CI: 54.3-66.1%) reported using it, mostly outside institutional frameworks. Notably, 80.2% of users initiated AI use within the past year. Independent predictors of frequent use included previous training (OR=2.44), employment in university hospitals (OR=2.14), and younger age (OR=1.36 per 5-year decrease). Main barriers were lack of training (61%), absence of institutional strategies (46%), and ethical concerns (50%). While 93.8% agreed that AI training programmes are necessary, only 18.4% had received formal training. Conclusions: A substantial gap exists between the favorable perception of AI and its actual integration into clinical practice within Spanish gastroenterology. The rapid adoption outside institutional frameworks underscores the urgent need for accredited training programmes and governance standards led by scientific societies.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Cap-and-Trade: Efficiency Incentives for Accessibility and Sustainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19886v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The race for artificial intelligence (AI) dominance often prioritizes scale over efficiency. Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies. As a call to action, we propose a cap-and-trade system for AI. Our system provably reduces computations for AI deployment, thereby lowering emissions and monetizing efficiency to the benefit of of academics and smaller companies.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[RHSIA: Real-time Hemodynamics Surrogation for Non-idealized Intracranial Aneurysms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19876v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflective Translation: Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Structured Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19871v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables.

| **[SONIC: Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19884v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Missing Modality Completion in Product Catalogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark. We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Invariant Trajectories for Multimodal Large Language Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Cognitive Benchmarks Reveal Foundational Visual Gaps in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16435v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans develop perception through a bottom-up hierarchy: from basic primitives and Gestalt principles to high-level semantics. In contrast, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are trained directly on complex downstream tasks, often bypassing these foundational visual capabilities. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a benchmark that digitizes 20 vision-centric subtests from FRCT, a well-established cognitive psychology assessment spanning four domains of human visual cognition. Furthermore, we design algorithms to automatically construct and validate unlimited test cases with controllable difficulty. Using VisFactor, we evaluate 23 frontier MLLMs, including both proprietary (e.g., GPT, Gemini) and open-source (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen) models. The best model achieves a score of only 30.17%. Models consistently fail on tasks such as mental rotation, spatial relation inference, and figure-ground discrimination, regardless of model size or prompting strategy. These findings suggest that performance improvements on existing general benchmarks might represent castles in the air instead of a genuine mastery of human-like visual cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Evaluated 23 SOTA MLLMs</p></details> |
| **[EmoBench-M: Benchmarking Emotional Intelligence for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04424v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the integration of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into robotic systems and various AI applications, embedding emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities into these models is essential for enabling robots to effectively address human emotional needs and interact seamlessly in real-world scenarios. Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Up to 36x Speedup: Mask-based Parallel Inference Paradigm for Key Information Extraction in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19613v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Factuality benchmark (CCFQA). Specifically, the CCFQA benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages, designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities.

| **[Towards Pixel-Level VLM Perception via Simple Points Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19228v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[UniPCB: A Unified Vision-Language Benchmark for Open-Ended PCB Quality Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19222v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to EACL'26 (main conference)</p></details> |
| **[BTCChat: Advancing Remote Sensing Bi-temporal Change Captioning with Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05895v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urbanization monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

| **[Evaluation of Oncotimia: An LLM based system for supporting tumour boards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19899v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[DuwatBench: Bridging Language and Visual Heritage through an Arabic Calligraphy Benchmark for Multimodal Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19898v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL-2026 (Main Track)</p></details> |
| **["Not in My Backyard": LLMs Uncover Online and Offline Social Biases Against Homelessnes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13187v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence in Spanish Gastroenterology: high expectations, limited integration. A national survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17011v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive innovation in medicine, yet its adoption within gastroenterology remains limited and poorly characterized. We aimed to examine knowledge, practical applications, perceived barriers, and expectations regarding AI among gastroenterology specialists in Spain. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a structured online survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology (SEPD) in 2025. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, patterns of AI use, perceptions, and educational needs. Descriptive statistics and multivariable models were applied. Results: Among 283 respondents (mean age 44.6 +/- 9.7 years), 87.5% acknowledged AI as a transformative tool, but only 60.2% (95% CI: 54.3-66.1%) reported using it, mostly outside institutional frameworks. Notably, 80.2% of users initiated AI use within the past year. Independent predictors of frequent use included previous training (OR=2.44), employment in university hospitals (OR=2.14), and younger age (OR=1.36 per 5-year decrease). Main barriers were lack of training (61%), absence of institutional strategies (46%), and ethical concerns (50%). While 93.8% agreed that AI training programmes are necessary, only 18.4% had received formal training. Conclusions: A substantial gap exists between the favorable perception of AI and its actual integration into clinical practice within Spanish gastroenterology. The rapid adoption outside institutional frameworks underscores the urgent need for accredited training programmes and governance standards led by scientific societies.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Cap-and-Trade: Efficiency Incentives for Accessibility and Sustainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19886v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The race for artificial intelligence (AI) dominance often prioritizes scale over efficiency. Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies. As a call to action, we propose a cap-and-trade system for AI. Our system provably reduces computations for AI deployment, thereby lowering emissions and monetizing efficiency to the benefit of of academics and smaller companies.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[RHSIA: Real-time Hemodynamics Surrogation for Non-idealized Intracranial Aneurysms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19876v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.</p></details> |  |
