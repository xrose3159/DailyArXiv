| **[Reward-free Alignment for Conflicting Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02495v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

| **[New explanations and inference for least angle regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02491v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efron et al. (2004) introduced least angle regression (LAR) as an algorithm for linear predictions, intended as an alternative to forward selection with connections to penalized regression. However, LAR has remained somewhat of a "black box," where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart "path" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population "correlation" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation. The LAR inference method is studied through simulation and illustrated with data examples.</p></details> | 50 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Secure Multi-User Linearly-Separable Distributed Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02489v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \(F = DE\), where a \(γ\)-sparse \(E\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \(δ\)-sparse \(D\) defines the connectivity between \(N\) servers and \(K\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns. We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \(k\) who observes $α_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $α_k-1$, and (ii) for each user, removing from \(\mathbf{D}\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \(K-1\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \(\mathbf{E}\) a basis of \(\mathrm{Null}(\mathbf{D})\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726v6)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on many language tasks but still struggle with complex multi-step reasoning across disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, as well as guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents to generate multidisciplinary questions. The central insight is the notion of Design Logic, a form of reusable meta-knowledge that encapsulates the structured process human experts use to transform knowledge into complex exam questions, enabling LLMs to generate new questions with the same complex reasoning patterns from entirely different source texts with explicit control over difficulty, diversity, and question types. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 Design Logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By designing a two-stage retrieve-and-generate mechanism to match these Design Logics with raw corpus, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen3 and Llama3 with our data substantially improves multidisciplinary reasoning and outperforms baseline datasets. Notably, by applying SFT on the base versions of these models using only our data, we even surpass their official final models that have undergone the full post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

| **[HumanX: Toward Agile and Generalizable Humanoid Interaction Skills from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02473v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling humanoid robots to perform agile and adaptive interactive tasks has long been a core challenge in robotics. Current approaches are bottlenecked by either the scarcity of realistic interaction data or the need for meticulous, task-specific reward engineering, which limits their scalability. To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration. Our experiments show that HumanX achieves over 8 times higher generalization success than prior methods, demonstrating a scalable and task-agnostic pathway for learning versatile, real-world robot interactive skills.</p></details> |  |

| **[MemSkill: Learning and Evolving Memory Skills for Self-Evolving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02474v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, hand-designed operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present \textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ViktorAxelsen/MemSkill</p></details> |

This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Superman: Unifying Skeleton and Vision for Human Motion Perception and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02401v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion analysis tasks, such as temporal 3D pose estimation, motion prediction, and motion in-betweening, play an essential role in computer vision. However, current paradigms suffer from severe fragmentation. First, the field is split between ``perception'' models that understand motion from video but only output text, and ``generation'' models that cannot perceive from raw visual input. Second, generative MLLMs are often limited to single-frame, static poses using dense, parametric SMPL models, failing to handle temporal motion. Third, existing motion vocabularies are built from skeleton data alone, severing the link to the visual domain. To address these challenges, we introduce Superman, a unified framework that bridges visual perception with temporal, skeleton-based motion generation. Our solution is twofold. First, to overcome the modality disconnect, we propose a Vision-Guided Motion Tokenizer. Leveraging the natural geometric alignment between 3D skeletons and visual data, this module pioneers robust joint learning from both modalities, creating a unified, cross-modal motion vocabulary. Second, grounded in this motion language, a single, unified MLLM architecture is trained to handle all tasks. This module flexibly processes diverse, temporal inputs, unifying 3D skeleton pose estimation from video (perception) with skeleton-based motion prediction and in-betweening (generation). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, demonstrate that our unified method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all motion tasks. This showcases a more efficient and scalable path for generative motion analysis using skeletons.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoT-RVS: Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Segmentation for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18561v4)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, aiming at generating a mask sequence from an input video given a complex and implicit text query. While existing works finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for the task, they still fail in video inputs given complex temporally-sensitive queries, indicating their lack of temporal and spatial integration in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose CoT-RVS, a novel framework employing the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these complex challenges by temporal-semantic reasoning: CoT-RVS analyzes the visible objects within a given frame that possibly match the language query (semantic), and chooses a corresponding keyframe for each object that can be observed effortlessly among all frames (temporal). Notably, the CoT-RVS framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. Our framework's training-free feature further allows its extension to process online video streams, where the CoT is used at test time to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that CoT-RVS significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

| **[Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction for KV Cache Management in Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02197v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of visual information into Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but the quadratic memory and computational costs of Transformer architectures remain a bottleneck. Existing KV cache eviction strategies fail to address the heterogeneous attention distributions between visual and text tokens, leading to suboptimal efficiency or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE), a KV cache eviction framework that optimizes text-visual token interaction in MLLMs by implementing Dual-Attention Pruning during pre-filling (leveraging visual token sparsity and attention variance) and a Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy (inspired by OS Recycle Bins) during decoding. HAE minimizes KV cache usage across layers, reduces computational overhead via index broadcasting, and theoretically ensures superior information integrity and lower error bounds compared to greedy strategies, enhancing efficiency in both comprehension and generation tasks. Empirically, HAE reduces KV-Cache memory by 41\% with minimal accuracy loss (0.3\% drop) in image understanding tasks and accelerates story generation inference by 1.5x while maintaining output quality on Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct model.</p></details> | 10 oages, 3 figures |
| **[Vision-DeepResearch Benchmark: Rethinking Visual and Textual Search for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02185v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced VQA and now support Vision-DeepResearch systems that use search engines for complex visual-textual fact-finding. However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLMEraser: Achieving Test-Time Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models through Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04217v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Size, Many Fits: Aligning Diverse Group-Wise Click Preferences in Large-Scale Advertising Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02033v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advertising image generation has increasingly focused on online metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), yet existing approaches adopt a ``one-size-fits-all" strategy that optimizes for overall CTR while neglecting preference diversity among user groups. This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings. Our code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/JD-GenX/OSMF.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate its SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Only Forward Once: An Efficient Compositional Judging Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16600v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis -- where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones -- and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q Cache: Visual Attention is Valuable in Less than Half of Decode Layers for Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01901v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are plagued by exorbitant inference costs attributable to the profusion of visual tokens within the vision encoder. The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI26 |

| **[Reward-free Alignment for Conflicting Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02495v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard. Code, model weights, and instructions are available at https://github.com/neural-processing-lab/MEG-XL .</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[New explanations and inference for least angle regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02491v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efron et al. (2004) introduced least angle regression (LAR) as an algorithm for linear predictions, intended as an alternative to forward selection with connections to penalized regression. However, LAR has remained somewhat of a "black box," where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart "path" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population "correlation" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation. The LAR inference method is studied through simulation and illustrated with data examples.</p></details> | 50 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Secure Multi-User Linearly-Separable Distributed Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02489v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \(F = DE\), where a \(γ\)-sparse \(E\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \(δ\)-sparse \(D\) defines the connectivity between \(N\) servers and \(K\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns. We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \(k\) who observes $α_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $α_k-1$, and (ii) for each user, removing from \(\mathbf{D}\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \(K-1\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \(\mathbf{E}\) a basis of \(\mathrm{Null}(\mathbf{D})\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726v6)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on many language tasks but still struggle with complex multi-step reasoning across disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, as well as guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents to generate multidisciplinary questions. The central insight is the notion of Design Logic, a form of reusable meta-knowledge that encapsulates the structured process human experts use to transform knowledge into complex exam questions, enabling LLMs to generate new questions with the same complex reasoning patterns from entirely different source texts with explicit control over difficulty, diversity, and question types. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 Design Logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By designing a two-stage retrieve-and-generate mechanism to match these Design Logics with raw corpus, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen3 and Llama3 with our data substantially improves multidisciplinary reasoning and outperforms baseline datasets. Notably, by applying SFT on the base versions of these models using only our data, we even surpass their official final models that have undergone the full post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

| **[HumanX: Toward Agile and Generalizable Humanoid Interaction Skills from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02473v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling humanoid robots to perform agile and adaptive interactive tasks has long been a core challenge in robotics. Current approaches are bottlenecked by either the scarcity of realistic interaction data or the need for meticulous, task-specific reward engineering, which limits their scalability. To narrow this gap, we present HumanX, a full-stack framework that compiles human video into generalizable, real-world interaction skills for humanoids, without task-specific rewards. HumanX integrates two co-designed components: XGen, a data generation pipeline that synthesizes diverse and physically plausible robot interaction data from video while supporting scalable data augmentation; and XMimic, a unified imitation learning framework that learns generalizable interaction skills. Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration. Our experiments show that HumanX achieves over 8 times higher generalization success than prior methods, demonstrating a scalable and task-agnostic pathway for learning versatile, real-world robot interactive skills.</p></details> |  |
