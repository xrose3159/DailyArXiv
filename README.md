| **[Manifold limit for the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06025v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 0 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[AdaFuse: Adaptive Ensemble Decoding with Test-Time Scaling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06022v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

| **[Chaining the Evidence: Robust Reinforcement Learning for Deep Search Agents with Citation-Aware Rubric Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06021v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing LLM-based deep search agents. However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/CaRR.</p></details> |  |
| **[LookAroundNet: Extending Temporal Context with Transformers for Clinically Viable EEG Seizure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06016v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.</p></details> |  |

While the time complexity of data structures supporting such accesses has been studied in depth, and efficient algorithms for many queries and common orders are known, their practical performance has received little attention. We provide an implementation covering a wide range of queries and orders; it allows us to investigate intriguing practical aspects, including the comparative performance of database systems and the relationship between direct access and its single-access counterpart.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Mechanisms for Representing, Indexing and Manipulating Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12143v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised and unsupervised learning using deep neural networks typically aims to exploit the underlying structure in the training data; this structure is often explained using a latent generative process that produces the data, and the generative process is often hierarchical, involving latent concepts. Despite the significant work on understanding the learning of the latent structure and underlying concepts using theory and experiments, a framework that mathematically captures the definition of a concept and provides ways to operate on concepts is missing. In this work, we propose to characterize a simple primitive concept by the zero set of a collection of polynomials and use moment statistics of the data to uniquely represent the concepts; we show how this view can be used to obtain a signature of the concept. These signatures can be used to discover a common structure across the set of concepts and could recursively produce the signature of higher-level concepts from the signatures of lower-level concepts. To utilize such desired properties, we propose a method by keeping a dictionary of concepts and show that the proposed method can learn different types of hierarchical structures of the data.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.</p></details> |  |

We propose Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a reinforcement learning framework that reformulates reasoning as a hierarchical search with self-verification. VAR enforces traceable evidence grounding by generating explicit bounding boxes, guided by a novel reward function combining geometric precision and semantic sufficiency. Furthermore, it replaces linear Chain-of-Thought with a tree-search policy capable of backtracking to correct logical errors. Theoretical analysis validates the framework's reliability, and extensive experiments demonstrate that VAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex hallucination and safety benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AtomThink: Multimodal Slow Thinking with Atomic Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11930v5)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal reasoning by incorporating the notion of ``slow thinking'' into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that models can learn to adaptively use different levels of reasoning to tackle questions of varying complexity. We propose a novel paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which consists of minimal semantic atomic steps. Unlike existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method not only generates flexible CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomenon of overthinking for easier tasks. To introduce structured reasoning into visual cognition, we design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules: (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single-step utilization rate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 $\times$ and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Kun-Xiang/AtomThink.</p></details> | TPAMI accepted |
| **[SOVABench: A Vehicle Surveillance Action Retrieval Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04824v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic identification of events and recurrent behavior analysis are critical for video surveillance. However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models. Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail. The code, annotations, and instructions to construct the benchmark are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at Real World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges, 6th (in WACV Workshops)</p></details> |
| **[SketchVL: Policy Optimization via Fine-Grained Credit Assignment for Chart Understanding and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05688v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RxnBench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Chemical Reaction Understanding from Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23565v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Beyond Context: A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15253v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, applications and industry deployment, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferability of Adversarial Attacks in Video-based MLLMs: A Cross-modal Image-to-Video Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042v4)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models - a common and practical real-world scenario - remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal large language model (I-MLLM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and spatiotemporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. Additionally, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as a surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rate (AASR) of 57.98% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for Zero-Shot VideoQA tasks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Stroke-Level Structural Analysis of Hieroglyphic Scripts without Language-Specific Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05508v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts.

Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity. Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI), is a critical but under-studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical deployment. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we take advantage of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by constructing a prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a "Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that HS is closely aligned with human evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics used for super-resolution (SR) models. Finally, we propose a few efficient HS proxies and demonstrate how diffusion-based GSR models can be fine-tuned to mitigate hallucinations, leveraging HS proxies as differentiable reward functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 21 figures, and 10 tables</p></details> |

| **[Manifold limit for the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06025v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 0 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[AdaFuse: Adaptive Ensemble Decoding with Test-Time Scaling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06022v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

| **[Chaining the Evidence: Robust Reinforcement Learning for Deep Search Agents with Citation-Aware Rubric Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06021v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing LLM-based deep search agents. However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/CaRR.</p></details> |  |
| **[LookAroundNet: Extending Temporal Context with Transformers for Clinically Viable EEG Seizure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06016v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Database Theory in Action: Direct Access to Query Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06013v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct access asks for the retrieval of query answers by their ranked position, given a query and a desired order. While the time complexity of data structures supporting such accesses has been studied in depth, and efficient algorithms for many queries and common orders are known, their practical performance has received little attention. We provide an implementation covering a wide range of queries and orders; it allows us to investigate intriguing practical aspects, including the comparative performance of database systems and the relationship between direct access and its single-access counterpart.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Mechanisms for Representing, Indexing and Manipulating Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12143v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised and unsupervised learning using deep neural networks typically aims to exploit the underlying structure in the training data; this structure is often explained using a latent generative process that produces the data, and the generative process is often hierarchical, involving latent concepts. Despite the significant work on understanding the learning of the latent structure and underlying concepts using theory and experiments, a framework that mathematically captures the definition of a concept and provides ways to operate on concepts is missing. In this work, we propose to characterize a simple primitive concept by the zero set of a collection of polynomials and use moment statistics of the data to uniquely represent the concepts; we show how this view can be used to obtain a signature of the concept. These signatures can be used to discover a common structure across the set of concepts and could recursively produce the signature of higher-level concepts from the signatures of lower-level concepts. To utilize such desired properties, we propose a method by keeping a dictionary of concepts and show that the proposed method can learn different types of hierarchical structures of the data.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.</p></details> |  |
